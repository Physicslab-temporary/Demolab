## Equipment   
 
 *  Pendulum; brass bob attached to a threaded rod (l=50cm) and connected to a support with ballbearing. 
 *  Large cardboard with the principal angles of deflection indicated on it (see Diagram).  
 *  Photogate. 
 *  Computerinterface. 
 *  Computer with data-acquisition system. (we use PASCO Science Workshop) Mathematical pendulum (2) Large angle
    
  
## Presentation   
 The photogate is placed just offset the rest-position of the pendulum. The data-acquisition system is set up in such a way that a graph of periodtimes can be presented. The data-acquisition is started, and by hand the pendulum is given a deflection of almost 180o and released. When q has reached angles smaller than 90o, the data-acquisition is stopped. During the data-acquisition the students observe the graph displayed (see red line in Figure 1).

 (This means that the expected range of the axes of the graph have to be prepared before the demonstration is started.) A second run is made, giving the pendulum the smallest deflection possible. After about 10-20 registrations of T the data-acquisition is stopped. The complete graph can be observed and discussed now.    
  
## Explanation   
 The equation that describes the motion of the mass m is given by 22sinsxdagdtq==- (x-direction along the tangent of the circle; see Figure2A). This is not a simple harmonic motion since sinq is not proportional to s. Only for small amplitude oscillations sinslqqÂ»=and the equation of motion reduces to22dsgsdtl=- This is the differential equation for simple harmonic motion. Then the period is given by 2lTgp= For large amplitudes we need sinxagq=-in stead of xagq=-. Since sinqq<, this means that ax is smaller than the small-amplitude equation indicates: The mass will need more time than 2lTgp= to reach its maximum deflection. In other words: T is Mathematical pendulum (2) Large angle larger than2lgp. (For an exact solution to the equation of motion: see literature.)    
  
## Remarks   
 
 *  Also see the demonstration "Mathematical pendulum (1) - Simple harmonic motion" in this database. With that demonstration the effect on the acceleration a can be observed very well. 
 *  When you observe the pendulum directly by eye it can be seen directly that the period of oscillation is larger at larger angles. 
 *  The software is setup in such a way that the period is presented after the pendulum has passed three times through the photogate. Every next period is presented after every second passage (see Figure2B).

 *  Since the system measures the complete period the position of the photogate can be at any arbitrary point along the arc of motion.
