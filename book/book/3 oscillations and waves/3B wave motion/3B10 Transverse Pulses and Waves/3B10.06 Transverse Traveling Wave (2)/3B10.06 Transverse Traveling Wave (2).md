 Transverse travelling wave (2)     
  
## Aim   
 To show a traveling wave and the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength.    
  
## Subjects

## Equipment   
 
 *  2 1-meter sections of the slow wave motion demonstrator. 
 *  1 dashpot filled with water
      
  
## Presentation   
 Couple the two sections of the wave motion demonstrator together. Connect the end of the complete demonstrator to the dashpot. Give, by hand, the beginning of the wave demonstrator a sharp up and down disturbance, so that one or two sine-waves travel along the demonstrator. (The dashpot minimizes reflections at the far end.) It can be observed that the speed of the travelling wave is independent of the frequency. Also the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength can be shown.
