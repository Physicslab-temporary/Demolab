## Equipment   
 
 *  Spiral filament lamp. 
 *  Safety connector to mains (220V/50Hz). 
 *  Bar magnet. Lorentz force (1)
    
  
## Presentation   
 The lamp is connected to the mains and the filament is glowing. The filament can be seen clearly.

``` 
 The bar magnet approaches the lamp and the individual turns of the spiral filament show themselves as broadened bands (see Figure 1). The filament performs a fast reciprocating motion    
  
## Explanation   
 The reciprocating motion of the filament indicates that a force is acting and that it is acting to and fro."To and fro" is caused by the constantly changing direction of the current (50Hz).
