## Equipment   
 
 *  bicycle wheel with handles 
 *  1 piece of rope 
 *  1 stick Precession (3a)
    
  
## Presentation   
 The wheel is rotating and held by a string. The rotating wheel has an angle of about 45°-60° with the vertical. The wheel will precess about a vertical axis. When the instructor pushes with the side of his hands or a stick against one of the handles of the wheel in the direction of precession, then the rotating wheel will rise to a more vertical position. This can be continued, even passing the vertical.    
  
## Explanation   
 The rotating wheel will precess due to gravitational torque, mgs (Iw0 moves in the direction of this gravitational torque; precession) (see figure 1).

 Figure 2  F is the applied force in the direction of precession (see figure 2). The applied torque is pointing vertically upward, so now Iw0 moves also upward.
