Aim: 
To show empirically that Kepler's third law is true.  
Subjects: 
1L20 (Orbits)

Equipment: 
- 
Graph on overhead sheet, T=f(a), T  and a both scaled logarithmically. 
- 
Table with data of the planetary system (see Sources). 

 
Presentation: The graph is projected by means of an overhead sheet. The relationship with the 
table of planetary data is elucidated. Clearly can be observed that the data fit on a straight line in such a double logarithmic graph. The slope of this line (p/q) equals 1.5. This is the relationship of the powers in Kepler's third law:

and a are graphed logarithmically (with x– and y-decades equally spaced), we see a line whose slope ( 3
