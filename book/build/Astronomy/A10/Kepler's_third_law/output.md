 *  Graph on overhead sheet, T=f(a), T  and a both scaled logarithmically. 
 *  Table with data of the planetary system (see Sources). Kepler’s third law
     
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The graph is projected by means of an overhead sheet. The relationship with the table of planetary data is elucidated. Clearly can be observed that the data fit on a straight line in such a double logarithmic graph. The slope of this line (p/q) equals 1.5. This is the relationship of the powers in Kepler's third law: . 23Ta∝  
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 Kepler's third law states . Taking logarithms on both sides, we can also 2.Tconsta=3write:  and: 2loglogTc=.3logonsta+3122loglog.logTconsta=+. So when T and a are graphed logarithmically (with x– and y-decades equally spaced), we see a line whose slope (32) is the power-relationship in the original function.   
<b> Simulations: </b>  
 On the internet you can find many simulations that are appropriate. For instance on: www.walter-fendt.de , www.physics.sjsu.edu/Tomley/demos.htm and www.astro.unl.edu/naap/pos/animations/kepler.swf .
