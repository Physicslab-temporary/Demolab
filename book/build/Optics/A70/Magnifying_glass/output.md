 When the lens is placed a distance f from the object, angular magnification becomes 0audMfaa==. Still the eye is close to the object. (see Figure1c) (Theoretically a larger distance between magnifying glass and object is possible but then distorsion occurs, since the eyelens sees the imageforming rays no longer paraxial.) When the object is a comfortable reading distance away analysis shows ()1LMfpdppf=-+  (see Figure1d).  So for maximum magnification the magnifying glass should be hold closely to the eye. To have a more comfortable situation you have to be content with a lower magnificaton.
