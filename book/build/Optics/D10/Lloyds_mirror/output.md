# Lloyds mirror 
     
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The room is darkened and the laser is switched on. By means of the +10 mm-lens an illuminated disk is projected on the white screen. The surface mirror is placed parallel to the diverging light beam (see figure 1)

<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The room is darkened and the laser is switched on. By means of the +10 mm-lens an illuminated disk is projected on the white screen. The surface mirror is placed parallel to the diverging light beam (see figure 1)     Figure 1 Figure 2  and then turned just a little, so that the outer rays of the beam are reflected (see figure 2). In the light spot on the wall the fringes are visible now.    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 A portion of the wavefront is reflected from S (see figure 3).

 The other portion proceeds directly to the screen. Interference occurs in the region where the two portions are superimposed S and its mirrorimage S1 can be considered as separate coherent sources, placed a distance a apart. Then the separation (Dy) between the fringes is given bysyalD» (s being the distance between the plane of the two sources and the screen).    
<b> Remarks: </b>  
 In the demonstration the distance between the fringes can be enlarged by placing the screen not perpendicular but more parallel to the beam.
