<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Etienne Malus was standing at the window of his house in the Rue d'Enfer (Paris) examining a calcite crystal. The sun was setting, and its image reflected towards him from the windows of the Luxembourg Palace not far away. He held up the crystal and looked through it at the sun's reflection. To his astonishment, he saw one of the double images of the sun disappear as he rotated the calcite! This historical situation is presented in our demonstration (see Diagram). The 12V-lamp is in our situation operating at 6V in series with a 2Ω/20W resistor. This is the red glowing setting sun. The acrylic sheet is a window of the palace and the camera is the eye of Etienne Malus. The beamer projects to the audience the image that Etienne saw: "window" and reflected image of the "sun" (see Figure 1A). Take care that the camera is focussed on the light spot and not on the “window” itself.

 The lay-out of the demonstration is such that the angle of incidence is about 60o. The large 30-60-90otriangle shows this to the students. Now the calcite crystal is placed in front of the camera-lens (see Figure 1B). Everything in the projected image is doubled. While rotating the crystal also the double images rotate, but at two positions of rotation the doubling of the reflected "sun" disappears and only one "sun" is seen! Brewster's angle (1)

 There appears zero amplitude for rpar at a certain angle. This angle can be found when using Snell's law in rpar: sincossincossincossincosiitpariitrtt. Rewriting (see textbooks) tan()tan()itparitr This can be zero when the denominator is infinite, so when 90it. In this situation, using Snell's law sinsiniitnntyields sinncosiitni , so tantiinn , or arctantiinn This is Brewster's law, formulated correctly in 1815. (Brewster was honoured half the prize of the French Institute in 1816.)  Acrylic sheet has n=1.5, so here Brewster's angle is: 56t. This is in correspondence with our setting up of the demonstration (angle of incidence is set at about 60o).    
<b> Remarks: </b>  
  Our calcite crystal "functions" better in one direction than the other. Find the
