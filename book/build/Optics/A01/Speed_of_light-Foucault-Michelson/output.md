<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Optical components (see Diagram). 
 *  Camera without lens (see Diagram). 
 *  Variable transformer to supply the motor of the rotating mirror. 
 *  5Vdc to supply the photodiode-circuit. 
 *  Monitor, connected to camera. 
 *  Double overheadsheet, explaining the assembly. Speed of light;  Foucault-Michelson
    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Preparation: Make the laserbeam go as horizontal as possible; careful alignment is essential in this demonstration. (Start at the laser and work step by step working yourself through the lightpath.) The +5m-lens is positioned at about 5m distance from the rotating mirror.

 Image-distance b (see Figure1A) is chosen such that the image of the first mirror (M1) is sharp at M3 111frfb=++.(In our assembly this means that b is around 25 meters.) Lens +5m and M3 are carefully adjusted until, in the right postion of the rotating mirror (Mr) the laserbeam is reflected to the camera (the camera and M1 have the same distance to M3). Making the rotating mirror turn at its highest speed (about 500 rev. per second) the lightspot displaces, in our assembly, the whole width of the monitorscreen. This displacement is calibrated by placing a plastic ruler between the greyfilter and the camera (see Figure2A).   Speed of light;  Foucault-Michelson

 Shadow projection of the mm-lines on the sensitive layer of the camera show these lines on the monitor (we have 7mm across the full width of the monitorscreen; see Figure2B). The geometry of the assembly makes it possible to link the rotation of the mirror to the displacement on the monitorscreen (we have a displacement of around 2.5mm on the camera, corresponding to332.5100.4810222.6dradrj--·===·· of Mr). Demonstration: The laser is switched on and the lightpath is shown to the students. By hand the rotating mirror is turned until a flash is seen on the monitorscreen. In this position the lightpath is as drawn in the Diagram. The principle of operation is explained to the students: In the time it takes the light beam to travel the distance Mr-M3-Mr the rotating mirror has made a little angle (f). This is observed on the monitorscreen (angle 2f; see Figure1B). Also the calibration is explained to the students. While the speed of rotation of Mr increases the students see an increasing displacement of the lightspot on the monitorscreen. While running at a convenient speed (we use n=500s-1 to make calculations easy), this reading and that of the displacement on the monitorscreen are used to calculate the speed of light.    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 During the time (Dt) it takes the light beam to travel the distance Mr-M3-Mr the rotating mirror has made a little angle (f) that is read from the monitorscreen. Observing the speed of rotation on the frequencymeter, the time it took to make this little angle can
