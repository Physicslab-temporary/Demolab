<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The spring is hung to a hook and loaded with a mass of 1kg. When the mass is at rest the sliding marker is positioned at the centre of mass (CM) of the 1kg mass (see Diagram). Then the mass is set in oscillatory motion and it can be observed that the mass oscillates around the original position of the CM. Finally, it will end at this position (due to damping). When the system still oscillates, it is brought to a stop. Taking the mass in your hand and positioing it above its rest position, makes it clear to the students that the force on the mass is directed towards the marker. The same is done by positioning the mass below the marker. he data-acquisition system shows a (still empty) graph of position versus time. Shortly, the functioning of the data-acquisition system is explained to the students (For instance, when moving your hand above the position sensor, the distance to the sensor is monitored on the presented position graph).

 Data-recording is started and the spring-mass system is set in motion again. When about 5 cycles are registered, the data-recording is stopped and the resulting position graph can be studied (see Figure1A: 1. When the mass rises above the marked rest position the first part (AB) of the curve shows that it slows down (because AB becomes more and more level). So during AB the force is downwardly directed. From B to C the graph shows that
