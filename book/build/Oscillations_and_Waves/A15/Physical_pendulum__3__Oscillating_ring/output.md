<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  2 large (steel) rings, f=600 with knife-edge suspension. These rings can be divided into 2/3 and 1/3. 
 *  mathematical pendulum, l=600 
 *  meterstick Physical pendulum (3) Oscillating ring
    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 One complete ring swings in its plane at the knife-edge on its periphery. A simple pendulum whose length is equal to the diameter of the ring is suspended beside it so the equality of periods can be observed. A second 2/3-ring is made swinging. It can be observed that the ring has still the same period! Again the same period is measured when 1/3-ring is swinging    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 • For a physical pendulum, the period T is given by 2AITmsgp=. If the pendulum is a complete ring, then s=R (see Figure 1), IA=IC+mR2 and

<b> Explanation: </b>  
 • For a physical pendulum, the period T is given by 2AITmsgp=. If the pendulum is a complete ring, then s=R (see Figure 1), IA=IC+mR2 and   Figuur 1 IC=mR2. Then 22TRgp=, so lr=2R. So a complete ring has the same period as a mathematical pendulum of length 2R.
