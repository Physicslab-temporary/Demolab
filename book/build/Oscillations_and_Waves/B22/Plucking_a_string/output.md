<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Sonometer with detector (we use PASCO WA9613). 
 *  Steel string, d=.5mm (μ=1.5x10-3kg/m). 
 *  Two masses (.5kg and 1kg). 
 *  Data-acquisition system (we use PASCO ScienceWorkshop).
      
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Set up the demonstration as shown in Diagram and connect the detector, that is placed near the string, to the interface. The software is set up to have an oscilloscope screen and an FFT display (frequency spectrum) as in Figure 1. 1. Load the string with .5kg (see Diagram, mass hanging at the end of the lever). Pluck, by hand/nail, the string (moving it in a vertical direction).We do this in two ways:  a.  Pluck the string in its centre. The scope display shows a more or less symmetric shape. The FFT display shows the frequency components in it. Using the crosshair cursor we read: 102-, 289-,  473-, 663Hz. Very roughly the relationship 1:3:5:7 is visible in these frequencies. b. Pluck the string close to its end.  The scope display shows a more or less sawtooth shape, and while it dampens becomes more or less sinusoidal. The FFT display shows the frequency components in it. The fundamental frequency is very high compared to the higher harmonics. (Using the crosshair cursor we read: 102-, 190-, 288-, 385-, 473-, 570-, 666-, 755-, 853Hz, etc. Very roughly the relationship 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9 is visible in these frequencies.) 2. Loading the string with another force.       a.  By hand. When the string is plucked, we pull the weight. We see on the FFT-display shift the frequency components to higher frequencies.       b. Load the string with 1kg. Again the string is plucked, first in its centre, and next close to its end. The observed frequencies are now: 2a: 140-, 268-, 405-, 541-, 677-, 799-, 939Hz; 2b: 140-, 405-, 678Hz (see Figure 1). Compare these data with the results of the first part of our demonstration and show that the ratio’s 140/102; 268/190; 405/288; 541/385; etc. are all very close to2.
