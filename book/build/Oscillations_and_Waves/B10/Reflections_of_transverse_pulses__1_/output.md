<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Heavy rubber hose (l=10 m). 
 *  Heavy weight (m=25kg; see the construction in Figure 1 and 2). 
 *  Tape. 
 *  Oil.

<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Lay the long piece of hose in a straight line on the floor in front of the lecture room. On the floor, this straight line is marked by tape (see Diagram). -At one end the hose is fixed (see Figure 1).  Fixed end

 Reflections of transverse pulses (1)    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Lay the long piece of hose in a straight line on the floor in front of the lecture room. On the floor, this straight line is marked by tape (see Diagram). -At one end the hose is fixed (see Figure 1).  Figure 1  Give, by hand, the free end of the hose a sharp horizontal displacement. A crest travels along the hose (see the pictures of Diagram A) and reflects at the fixed end as a trough. -Next the hose is fixed as a loose end (see Figure 2).  Fixed end BLoose end

 The end of the hose can now freely move sideways; it is a so-called "free end‚Äù. (We apply some oil on the metal shaft to reduce friction.) The demonstration is repeated and it can be observed that a crest travelling along the hose now returns as a crest (see the pictures of Diagram B).    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 -When the hose has a fixed end, the arriving pulse exerts a force on the support. The reaction to this force, exerted by the support on the string, "kicks back" on the string (Newton's third law; conservation of momentum) and sets up a reflected pulse in the reverse direction. -When the hose has a free end, the free moving support exerts no transverse force. When the arriving pulse displaces the free end sideways, it even overshoots the arriving pulse. In the hose a force pulls it back to its rest position. This generates the reflected pulse, and so the direction of displacement is the same as for the initial pulse.
