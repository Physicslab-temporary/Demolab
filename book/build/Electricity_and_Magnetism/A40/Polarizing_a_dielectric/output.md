# Polarizing a dielectric 
    
<b> Aim: </b>  
 To show what happens inside a material that is placed in an electric field (and in which the molecules have no dipole moment).    
<b> Subjects: </b>

<b> Equipment: </b>  
 An assembly of overheadsheets: 
 *  Overheadsheet with capacitor drawn on it. 
 *  Overheadsheet with six rows of six negative charges (green colored). 
 *  Overheadsheet with six rows of six positive charges (red colored). The overheadsheet with the capacitorplates drawn on it is actually a sleeve, in which the two sheets with the opposite charges just fit and can be shifted.
      
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The assembly of overheadsheets is projected: The two sheets with the opposite charges are placed between the capacitor plates such that the plus - and minus signs cover each other (the molecules are no dipoles) (See Diagram A and Figure 1).

 Using a non-permanent marker we apply (write) a clear PLUS- and MINUS-sign to the capacitor plates and by hand the two sheets with the charges are shifted a little, thus showing that the "molecular charges" are seperated a little (see DiagramB). The net effect is clearly visible: There is a net negative charge on the outer edge of the material facing the positive plate and a net positive charge on the opposite side. We can also draw the vectors to indicate the original electric field (E0) and the induced, opposing field (Eind), showing that now EDielectric=E0-Eind.    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 When an outside electric field is applied to the material (for instance by placing it between the plates of a capacitor) there is some seperation of charge induced in the molecules. In the demonstration this is shown by slightly displacing the "negative"-overheadsheet towards the positive plate (opposite to the direction of E0).    
<b> Remarks: </b>  
 
 *  The model is static; there is no thermal motion.
