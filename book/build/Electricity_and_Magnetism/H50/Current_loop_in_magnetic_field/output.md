## Equipment   
 
 *  Two Neodymium magnets fixed in clamps. 
 *  Coil (n=500; maxI= 2.5A) with a piece of red tape at one side. The coil is suspended by thin thread, so it can rotate easily (see Diagram). 
 *  Power supply, 30V/10A. 
 *  Switch and Two-way switch. 
 *  Array of compass-needles (Leybold Didactic 56061). 
 *  Paperclip (to show the presence of a magnetic field). 
 *  Camera and screen to show the demo to a large audience.   
  
## Safety   
 
 *  The Neodymium magnets are very strong. If these magnets are not handled carefully, there is risk of serious injury. The magnets are fixed in clamps and stored with a thick piece of sheet between them.                                              -Carefully slide them apart when you use them, to prevent your fingers becoming trapped between them.                                                                  -Keep them several meters away from magnetic information carriers.                -Never operate the magnets in explosive environments, since they generate sparks!
     
  
## Presentation   
 Using the array of compass needles we show that there is a uniform magnetic field between the permanent magnets (see Figure 1).

## Presentation   
 Using the array of compass needles we show that there is a uniform magnetic field between the permanent magnets (see Figure 1).  Figure 1  Close to the magnets the field is strongly divergent/convergent (see Figure 2).

 Then the coil is suspended between the two magnets (see Diagram). Connecting the power supply to the coil shows that the coil makes a rotation and lines up with the magnetic field (see Figure 3). There it remains at rest. Conclusion is that in a homogeneous magnetic field a current carrying coil (a dipole) experiences a torque that lines up that dipole with the field. And in that uniform field there is no net force.

   Figure 3  Then the coil is displaced a little from its central position: It attracts itself towards one of the magnets and sticks there (see Figure 4).

 Conclusion is that in a non-uniform field there is a net force on a current loop (dipole).    
  
## Explanation   
 There are Lorentz-forces on all sides of the coil. The forces on the bottom- and topside of the coil cancel (they only tend to stretch the coil). The two forces on the sides are also equal and opposite but they do generate a torque N. NmB (Bis the magnetic field andA, A being the area of the current loop). When the field is non-uniform, there is a radial component of B and there will be a net force towards the magnet (see Figure 5). magnet Current loop IdownIup BFF

## Remarks   
 
 *  The lining up of a current loop in a uniform field is an example of what dipoles do in a material. So it can be used as an example to present para-magnetism.
