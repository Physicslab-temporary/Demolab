## Equipment   
 
 *  Lamp, 220V/200W. 
 *  Coil, n=500; R=2.5Ω. 
 *  U-core with bar. 
 *  2 Demonstration meters. 
 *  Safety connection box (Leybold 50206). 
 *  Measuring junction box (Leybold 50205. See Figure 4). 
 *  Net-adapter for mobile telephone (or other appliance).   
  
## Safety   
 
 *  It’s a circuit connected to mains voltage (220V/50Hz). That’s why we use a safety connection box. This box shows a green light when the mains is disconnected and a red light when the mains is connected.  Self-inductance in AC-circuit
    
  
## Presentation   
 The circuit is build as shown in Figure 1 and in Diagram. First we show the circuit set-up to the students and then connect the two Voltmeters.    220V/50H

 Self-inductance in AC-circuit    
  
## Presentation   
 The circuit is build as shown in Figure 1 and in Diagram. First we show the circuit set-up to the students and then connect the two Voltmeters.    Figure 1  1. Connecting the 220V to the circuit makes the lamp glows strongly (see Figure 2A). The Voltmeter connected to the lamp reads almost 220V: All voltage appears across the lamp; just a very little voltage is read across the coil. Conclusion is that only a very small emf of self-inductance is generated in the coil. 2. The bar is partly shifted on to the U-core. As soon as the bar touches the second leg of the U-core the lamp dims (see figure 2B). the Voltmeter across the lamp shows a lower voltage now and at the same time we observe an increase in voltage across the coil. Conclusion is that there is now a higher emf of self-inductance that opposes the 220V.   220V/50H

 Self-inductance in AC-circuit 3. When the bar is shifted completely on to the U-core, the lamp only glows very faintly. The voltage read across it is very low. The voltage across the coil is almost 220V now! Conclusion is that the emf of self-inductance generated in the coil is almost 220V now.Shifting the bar back and forth across the U-core makes the lamp dim less or more. 4. Finally we disconnect the lamp. Now only the self-inductance is connected to the 220V (see Figure 3).  220V/50HA V

Figure 3  Now the effect of self-inductance is most clear: the voltmeter reads 220V across the coil, and only a small current is flowing (we measure 0.4A). When there would be no self-inductance, the current would be 220V/2.5Ω=88A! Conclusion is that the emf of self-inductance really opposes the applied voltage. 5. The same demonstration is performed with a commercial net-adapter (used as charger for a mobile telephone; see Figure 4). Here also only the primary coil of the   220V/50HA V

 adapter is connected to the mains. We read a current of only 0.3mA! Self-inductance in AC-circuit   
  
## Explanation   
 The emf induced in a coil is, from Faraday’s law: BddINLdtdt; L being the coefficient of self-inductance. For a solenoid with a core (r)this is: 20rNALl20rNALl. This shows that the higherL, the higher the emf of self-inductance. Shifting the bar across the core changes L, and so the induced emf.   
  
## Remarks   
 
 *  The core on the bar makes a lot of noise. This is a 100Hz mains hum due to the mains frequency (50Hz). 
 *  The effect of self-inductance can also be translated into impedance of the circuit. In our demonstration 4. the circuit shows an impedance of 220V/0.4A=550Ω instead of the 2.5Ω of the copper coil. 
 *  In figure B we read 130coilVV and 110lampVV. Students easily read this as a total of 240V, so higher than the applied 220V. Phase-shift between these two voltages is responsible for that. The situation must be something like Figure 5 below shows.                        130V 220V current
