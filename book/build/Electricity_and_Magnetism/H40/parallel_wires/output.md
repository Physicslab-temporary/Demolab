 Parallel wires   
<b> Aim: </b>  
 To show that parallel wires attract or repel depending on the current direction.

<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Two long wires, 1.5m each 
 *  Power supply (we use 20 Amp.) 
 *  Ammeter 
 *  White screen Parallel wires
    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The two long wires are suspended from one clamp, close to the rigid white screen. One of the wires is also clamped at the lower end of the white screen and stretched. The second wire is hanging freely in such a way that at the lower end it is about 2 cm seperated from the fixed wire (see Diagram and Figure1).

 Parallel wires    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The two long wires are suspended from one clamp, close to the rigid white screen. One of the wires is also clamped at the lower end of the white screen and stretched. The second wire is hanging freely in such a way that at the lower end it is about 2 cm seperated from the fixed wire (see Diagram and Figure1).     Figure 1 Figure 2  The wiring is set up in such a way that both wires conduct the current in the same direction (Figure1). When switching on the current we see that the "loose" wire moves closer to the fixed wire. Then the wiring is changed so that the two wires conduct the current in opposite directions (Figure2). Switching on the current now shows that the "loose" wire is moving away from the fixed wire.    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 The magnetic induction around a current-carrying wire equals:()012IBrrmp= and is directed circularly around that wire (corkscrew). The force on a current in a magnetic field equals ()2FIlBr=and is directed perpendicular to I2 and B. uo being 4p.10-7 Hm-1 leads to 7122.10IIlFr-=. Applying the rigth-hand rule shows the direction of this force between current I1 (B) and I2 (see Figure3).
