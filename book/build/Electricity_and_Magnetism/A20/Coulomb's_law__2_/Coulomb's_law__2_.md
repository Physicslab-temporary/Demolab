## 

Presentation: The balls are hanging and touch each other. The shadow of the ping-pong balls is projected on the blackboard. 

By means of the Van de Graaff generator the two balls are charged and immediately they separate by electrostatic repulsion. While the shadows of the two balls are dancing around towards their equilibrium, the method of the demonstration is explained to the students and to them it is shown that when we suppose the power in Coulomb's law (1785) is really -2, the determined distance-ratio should be 21/3=1.259 
(see Explanation). When the two balls have come to rest, the centres of the shadows of the balls are chalk-marked on the blackboard. Now the two threads are sandwiched at the halfway point by means of a sliding piece of tape. (This tape is fixed to the threads already before you start the experiment; see Figure 1.) Clearly can be seen that the two shadows are closer to each other now. Again the centres of the ball-shadows are chalk-marked. On the blackboard the two separations are measured. (In a trial, we measured 78- and 62 cm respectively.) The ratio is calculated (78/62=1.258).This value is very close to the value 1.259 mentioned before and so the power in Coulomb's law being-2 is supported by this demonstration. 

This demonstration gives the opportunity to stress to the students that Coulomb's law is empirical and in that way very fundamental to the theory of electromagnetism. 

That's why it is very fundamental that measurements around Coulomb's law are still performed, trying to determine n with increasing accuracy (nowadays -1971- it stands to be accurate to 1 part in 1016 ; between 1,99999999999999994 and 
2,00000000000000058)

In this way measuring 1r  and 2r  will give us the value for n. 

The mentioned measurement in the Presentation with 1r =78cm and 2r =62cm presents the ratio

=1,258.. the table above shows that this produces a value for n r r

very close to 2. 

 

Remarks: 
- 
Measuring r1 and r2 must be done with some care. For instance when you 
measure r2 being 63cm in stead of 62cm you find n=2,2(5) in stead of 
n=2,0(2). 
- 
When charge leaks away during the demonstration the measured r2 will be 
too low making 
1
higher and n will appear as a higher value. (So usually this 
r
r

will happen.) 
- 
At 3/4 from the upper side of the support a horizontal bar is placed (see 
Diagram). This makes that when the balls move when they deflect, they remain in the same vertical plane. Without this bar the balls will start to rotate, making a useful shadow projection impossible. Nowadays we use a 
thin double thread instead of a metal bar; a metal bar that close to the balls 
disturbs the E-field more than a thin thread. The balls hang between the double, horizontal threads.
