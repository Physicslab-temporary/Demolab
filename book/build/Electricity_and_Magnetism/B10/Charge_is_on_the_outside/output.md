# Charge is on the outside 
 .   
<b> Aim: </b>  
 To show that charge is on the outside of a conductor as an application of Gauss's law.    
<b> Subjects: </b>

<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Two large metal sieves, one mounted with an electroscope. They are mounted on heavy wooden blocks. 
 *  Two large blocks of styrofoam. 
 *  Van de Graaff generator. 
 *  Camera. .
    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The two metal hemispheres (sieves) are placed on the styrofoam blocks and placed in such a way that they make a complete metal sphere. The two metal hemispheres are electrically connected and together they are connected to a Van de Graaff generator. The camera is sharply focussed on the electroscope so that it is clearly visible through the metal sieve. The students are asked to predict what will happen to the electroscope when the metal sphere is charged. The Van de Graaff generator is switched on and charges the closed metal sphere. The electroscope inside shows no deflection (see Figure1).

The electroscope inside shows no deflection (see Figure1).   Figure 1  Now students are asked to predict what will happen to the electroscope when the charged metal sphere is seperated into two halves. The sphere is opened by pulling one sieve away (pulling the styrofoam block) and immediately the electroscope shows a deflection (see Figure2). Closing the metal sphere again makes the deflection of the electroscope zero again.
