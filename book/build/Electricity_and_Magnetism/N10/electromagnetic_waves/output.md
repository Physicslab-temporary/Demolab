<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Preliminary explanation. The UHF transmitter box contains a circuit that resonates at around 434 MHz. In the output of this circuit, conducting rods of different length can be plugged in. When the wavelength () of the E-field of this 434 MHz signal is calculated, we find  is around 70 cm (the electric field E travels at 3x108 m/s). A. STANDING ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES ON CONDUCTORS. The metal two-legged loop, having a length of 35 cm (Lecher-line), is plugged into the transmitter output. Place the lamp-probe with its pvc block on the two-legged loop and slide it along the legs of the loop (see Diagram A). The lighting lamp shows: VR-R=0, rising to VS-S=max. and then diminishing to VT-T=0.  This pattern can be understood when showing that a full standing E-wave fits into the total length of 70 cm. Then there are E-nodes at 17.5cm (/4) and at 52.5 cm (3/4). At 35 cm (/2) there is an antinode. Figure1A shows this E-pattern and clarifies that maximum potential difference occurs between S and S. (S-S is an in intensity oscillating dipole.)

 Then the coil with n=10.000 is connected to a 100A demonstration meter via the h.f. rectifier diode (see Diagram A). The coil is placed on a cart and slides slowly and close (2cm distance) along one of the legs of the conducting rods. The demonstration meter shows where induction along the leg happens, it shows the nodes and antinodes of the magnetic field B along the conducting rod; so it shows the standing current pattern in the conducting rod. We find B-nodes and antinodes on the places opposing those of the E-field. (see also: Remarks) Then longer two-legged loops are build (Lecher system; see Diagram B). This Lecher system makes itpossible to investigate the standing electromagnetic wave in longer variants, either shorted or open ended (Figure 1B, 1C and 1D are possible examples). Sliding the lamp-probe and/or the coil in these examples will strengthen the idea of standing E- and B-waves on the conductors.  (When needed to illustrate that a standing wave is related to length, the demonstration "Handheld
