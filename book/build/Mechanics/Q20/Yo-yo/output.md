## Presentation   
 We all know the yo-yo: Two circular discs with a common shaft and a string several times wrapped around it. Hold the end of the string stationary and release the yo-yo. The string unwinds as the yo-yo drops and rotates with increasing speed. When the unwrapping is completed, the yo-yo climbs again, comes to a stop and starts over again. etc. Suspending the yo-yo to a force sensor, a registration of the tension in the string is made (red graph in Figure1). When, finally, the yo-yo has come to rest, such a registration is repeated (green line in Figure1).

 Figure 2  When studying these graphs, the jerk at the turning point is clearly observed. (Also a strong vibration.) See that the jerk at the turning point is much higher than the weight of the yo-yo. Going from one jerk to the next, the highest position of the yo-yo is halfway between the two jerks. When a complete cycle is enlarged (see Figure2), it is clear that during the complete cycle the string tension is lower than the weight of the yo-yo.        
  
## Explanation   
 The yo-yo accelerates (a) due to a force ma=mg-Fs (Fs being the string tension and m the mass of the yo-yo.) When there is no string, then Fs=0 and a=g (free fall); With a string, a is always smaller than g: sFagm=− When Fs is just a little smaller than mg, then a will be very small. The angular acceleration (α) of the roll during its fall can be found fromIτα=, where the net torque (τ) is given by τ=mgr. The acceleration of the center of mass (a) is related to the angular acceleration of the yo-yo by a=αr, so the yo-yo accelerates downward by2mgraI=. Our yo-yo is a simple double disc, so 212CMImR=. It rolls at the circumference of the shaft (radius r), that's why 2122ImRmr=+, and we find for the acceleration: 2222gaRr=+. Because R>>r, a<<g. With our yo-yo we have R=150mm and r=12mm, so a=0.012g. Also the string tension can be calculated now: sFmgma=−, so: , 0.012sFmgmg=−showing that the string tension is just a little lower than the weight of the yo-yo.    
  
## Remarks   
 
 *  A worthwhile observation is, that when the string is unwrapped completely and the yo-yo starts climbing again, that the yo-yo's translational velocity changes its direction (-v to +v) but keeps its rotation in the same direction. In other words: its momentum changes direction (-mv to +mv), but there is no change in angular momentum. The large change of momentum (2mv) at this point of the yo-yo's movement explains the jerk (the change of momentum takes place in a very short time). 
 *  See also the demonstration "Maxwheel" in this database in order to link the measured string tension to the acceleration of the yo-yo. Usually we show these two demonstrations together.
