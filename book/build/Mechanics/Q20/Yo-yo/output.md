<b> Presentation: </b>  
 We all know the yo-yo: Two circular discs with a common shaft and a string several times wrapped around it. Hold the end of the string stationary and release the yo-yo. The string unwinds as the yo-yo drops and rotates with increasing speed. When the unwrapping is completed, the yo-yo climbs again, comes to a stop and starts over again. etc. Suspending the yo-yo to a force sensor, a registration of the tension in the string is made (red graph in Figure1). When, finally, the yo-yo has come to rest, such a registration is repeated (green line in Figure1).

 Figure 2  When studying these graphs, the jerk at the turning point is clearly observed. (Also a strong vibration.) See that the jerk at the turning point is much higher than the weight of the yo-yo. Going from one jerk to the next, the highest position of the yo-yo is halfway between the two jerks. When a complete cycle is enlarged (see Figure2), it is clear that during the complete cycle the string tension is lower than the weight of the yo-yo.
