<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Preparation. The ramp has to be adjusted horizontally in its cross direction, using an air-level. The two clamps (see Diagram B) are placed in such a way that in starting, the shelf, while pressed against these clamps, is nicely perpendicular to the long side of the ramp. A heavy wooden beam keeps the ramp at the end of the table. This beam also stops the rolling objects. Presentation. Different races are presented to the students. Before each race, the mass of the racing objects is determined by placing each object on the balance. Then students are asked to predict the result of that race: Is there a winner/loser? When the answer is yes, which object will be the winner/loser? 
 *  Race 1: m1, m2 and m3 race down the ramp together, starting at the same time. m1 is the winner, m3 the looser. (Most students predict the right answer. Evidently the distribution of mass is important.) 
 *  Race 2: m2 and m4 race down the ramp together. There is no winner. (Most students predict the wrong answer. Evidently mass is not important in this demonstration. It makes me remember Galileo dropping objects from the tower of Pisa, in which experiment mass has also no influence on the downward acceleration.) 
 *  Race 3: m2, m4 and m5 race down the ramp together. They arrive together; there is no winner. (Many students don't dare to predict. Evidently radius R is of no importance in this experiment.) Now an overheadsheet is presented to the students that shows a table of the expressions of moments of inertia of the various rolling objects. When mass m and radius R are of no importance in these downhill races then the difference will be found in the factor ahead of mR2 in the expressions of the moment of inertia. After this observation the next races will be predicted right by (almost) all students. 
 *  Race 4: m2, m6 and m7. m6 is the winner, m7 the loser. Figure 1 shows a summary.

<b> Explanation: </b>  
 Rolling down means translational acceleration plus rotational acceleration. The more    energy is needed for rotational acceleration, the less energy is left for translational acceleration. Conservation of energy tells us: 1/2mvc2+1/2Iw2+mgh=constant. By vc=wR, h=ssing and differentiating, we find 2sin1ccgaImRg=+ The moment of inertia of objects with circular symmetry can be written as: I=CmR2, where C is a constant. From tables we know (see Figure1): 
 *  solid sphere, C=2/5 
 *  solid cilinder, C=1/2 
 *  hollow sphere, C=2/3 
 *  hollow cilinder, C=1 
 *  cilinder with thickness (R2-R1), 211221RCR=+  Using C in the expression above, we find: sin1cgaCg=+  The larger C, the smaller ac. Also note that ac does not depend
 on m or R!    
<b> Remarks: </b>  
 
 *  To have a fair race you need to have a good starting procedure. We get the best start by using a shelf, blocking the objects in the starting position. Starting is done by very quickly moving the shelf away into the direction of the descending ramp. 
 *  When racing the basketball and ping pong ball (Race 5) there is no winner. Makes sure that in starting, the basketball is not
 ahead of the ping pong ball.
