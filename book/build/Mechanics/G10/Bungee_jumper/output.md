# Bungee jumper 
    
<b> Aim: </b>  
 To show that a bungee jumper falls with an acceleration greater than g.    
<b> Subjects: </b>

<b> Equipment: </b>  
  Chain, l= 6m, a wooden block fixed to the end.  Double ladder.  2 wooden blocks.  2 wooden blocks, one painted red, the other yellow and fixed to the chain.  Clamping material to fix the chain to the ladder (see Diagram).   
<b> Safety: </b>  
  In the pictures the demonstrator is standing with his hands free. (We did so to make the picture clearer.) When you stand on the ladder, hold yourself!
     
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The ladder is placed and the chain with the yellow block is fixed to it. It hangs from such a height that the yellow block just touches the ground when it all hangs down (see Diagram A in which the end with the yellow block is temporarily fixed to the ladder). -First two small blocks of wood are kept fixed, squeezed between your thumb and forefinger. When you let them go they fall together towards the ground and touch it at the same time (see Diagram B and Figure 1). The two blocks fall together

Figure 1 The two blocks fall together  -The the red block and the yellow block, that is fixed to the chain, are held between your fingers (see Diagram C). Then let them go (see Diagram D) and observe that the yellow block touches the ground before the free falling red one does. The difference in displacement can be observed already during the falling of the blocks (see Figure 2), but certainly at the touch down, when two bumps are heard.  red block     yellow  block

 The block fixed to the chain reaches the ground before the free falling block does.
