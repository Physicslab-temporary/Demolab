<b> Equipment: </b>  
  Conical beaker, 2 liter, filled with water.  Rubber stop.  Ping-pong ball tied to rubber stop (see Diagram).   
<b> Safety: </b>  
  The conical beaker filled with water is quite heavy (m2kg). Hold it firmly!
     
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Hold the conical beaker filled with water upside-down in your hands. The ping-pong ball stands vertically above the rubber stop. Make yourself turn in a circle and while turning observe the ping-pong ball (see Figure 1).

<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Hold the conical beaker filled with water upside-down in your hands. The ping-pong ball stands vertically above the rubber stop. Make yourself turn in a circle and while turning observe the ping-pong ball (see Figure 1).  Figure 1  The ping-pong ball is displaced towards you.    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 The ping-pong ball being completely immersed in water experiences an upward thrust Fu that is larger than its weight mg. The net force (Fu-mg) is directed upwards. The tension T in the string prevents that the ping-pong ball floats upwards (see Figure 2a).

 When turning around in circles the ping-pong ball is forced to move in a circle. A centripetal force is needed for that. Figure 2b shows the new situation of equilibrium: the net upward force and tension are compensated by a centripetal force Fc.. Any other position of the ping-pong ball is not a situation of equilibrium (drawing a free body diagram of the forces will show this).    
<b> Remarks: </b>  
  When an air-bubble is trapped in the conical beaker filled with water, this bubble will behave in the same way as the ping-pong ball does.  When you move the system from left to right, the acceleration on the left side and the deceleration on the right side can be observed. In general: the system can be used as an acceleration-meter.
