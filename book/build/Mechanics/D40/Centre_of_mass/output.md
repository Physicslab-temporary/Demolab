# Centre of mass 
     
<b> Aim: </b>  
 To show that when there are only internal forces acting in a body, the centre of mass does not move.

<b> Equipment: </b>  
  Track (2.2m, PASCO ME-9452), levelled.  Two carts (PASCO ME-9454).  Bent rail track on frame, with "ball catcher" (plastic coffee cup) and a pointer fixed to it (see Diagram). The bent rail track is fixed firmly to the two carts. Take also care that the two carts are nicely in line.  Steel ball (m=1kg).  Graduated ruler, l=1m.  Small wooden beam.  Balance with large display.   
<b> Safety: </b>  
  The steel ball is heavy. Handle it with attention so it will not drop on the floor (on your feet).
      
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The set-up is shown to the students. Then the mass of the cart-assembly is measured by the balance (4kg) and also that of the steel ball (1kg).Next, the centre of mass of the cart-assembly is determined by balancing this assembly on the small wooden beam. Then the assembly is set at rest in the middle of the levelled cart-track and the pointer is fixed to the assembly in its centre of mass. Furthermore this pointer-position is marked on the table by placing a piece of chalk upright.   33 cm10N 40N x 20 cm Line of (total) CM 10N 67cmy40N

 By hand the steel ball is placed at the slope of the bent track. We place it about 33 cm away from the point of reference on the assembly. With our other hand we hold the cart-assembly in its rest position. Then we let go, and the ball rolls down the bent track. The whole assembly is moving, and the steel ball is captured in the plastic coffee cup (a small piece of modelling clay at the low side at the entrance of the cup takes care that the steel ball remains in the cup). This plastic cup is 67 cm away from the centre of mass of the cart-assembly. When the ball is captured, the whole assembly is immediately at rest again. The difference is that the whole assembly is shifted (about) 20cm to the side where the ball came from (see the pictures in the Diagram, where the actual displacement is larger due to the higher starting point of the steel ball).    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 Our steel ball has a mass of 1kg. The cart-assembly (with carts, track and cup etc.) has a mass of 4kg. With our starting position at 33cm away from the point of reference, this gives a sketch of the situation as shown in the first picture of Figure 1.
