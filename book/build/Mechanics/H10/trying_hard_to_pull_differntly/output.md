<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Two force sensors (we use Pasco CI-6537). 
 *  Rubber band. 
 *  Data-acquisition via Science Workshop. 
 *  Beamer to project the monitor screen Trying hard to pull differently
    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 On the monitor two graphs are presented for each force sensor. The software is set in such a way that one of the sensors presents -F. Two demonstrators take each one of the sensors. They start both pulling randomly. The display shows clearly that whatever they do, both force sensors measure the same force: F and -F (see Figure1).

 Also when one of the demonstrators holds his force sensor without moving it, while the other demonstrator moves again randomly, then both force sensors registrate an equal F and -F. The registration does not reveal which of the two demonstrators is not moving his sensor.    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 Again the truth of Newton's third law is verified.
