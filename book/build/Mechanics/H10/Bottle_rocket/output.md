<b> Equipment: </b>  
  Rail (l=2.50 m).  Cart with wheels, hanging on rail.  Decantation bottle with cork in bottom opening (opening  25mm).  Tray as long as rail to catch the water.  Shield at the beginning of the tray.   
<b> Safety: </b>  
  It is inevitably that in this demonstration water will spoil on the ground. In our lecture-hall this makes the ground very slippery!
