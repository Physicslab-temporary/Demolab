<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Two light carts, easily rolling. 
 *  Rope; l=10m. 
 *  Two students.
      
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The two students stand each on a cart. Between them is a slackened rope. Slowly they increase the tension in the rope and at a certain moment both carts start moving towards each other. The rope slackens again, but both carts keep on moving. (Eventually friction will stop their movement.) When there is a clear massdifference between the two students, the difference in their respective speeds will be clearly observable.    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 The tension in the rope implies an impulse FDt to the cart + student. This impulse changes the momentum p=m1Dv1 of the cart + student. Applying Newton's second law we can say: FDt=m1Dv1. When the initial velocity is zero, then m1 will move with v1 after the short impulse is over. Applying 'conservation of linear momentum' to the whole system it is clear that the change of momentum of m2 is -Dp=m2Dv2 . v2 will be opposite to v1 and when m2>m1, v2 will be lower than v1.
