<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Two collision carts with magnetic bumpers on both ends. 
 *  Masses for carts. 
 *  Cart track, 2.2 m, with end-stops. 
 *  Mass balance.
     
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 In explaining the situations demonstrated, a rule introduced by Huygens can be used: 'If in an elastic collision the sum of the impulses equals zero, then both objects reverse and have the same speed after the collision as before the collision.' (CM coordinate system.)

<b> Explanation: </b>  
 In explaining the situations demonstrated, a rule introduced by Huygens can be used: 'If in an elastic collision the sum of the impulses equals zero, then both objects reverse and have the same speed after the collision as before the collision.' (CM coordinate system.)  Figure 1  This rule can easily be verified in applying conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy. This method is shown here for situation 1 only, for the other situations the result is shown (see Figure 1 and -2). Figure 2 showes the observed â€“v1 and v2 after the collision.
