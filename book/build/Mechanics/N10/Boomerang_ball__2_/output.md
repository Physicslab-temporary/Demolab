<b> Aim: </b>  
 The concept of impulse explains this very peculiar behavior of a bouncing ball.

<b> Equipment: </b>  
  Superball.  Table.   
<b> Safety: </b>  
  A superball can jump into many unexpected directions, so mind vulnerable objects in the neighborhood. Boomerang ball (2)
    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The table is positioned as shown in Diagram. The ball is thrown as shown. The ball bounces to a fro.    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 As a basis to explanation see the demonstration "Boomerang ball (1)" in this database. Using a large basketball thrown against the floor and then bouncing against a vertical wall, shows that after hitting the vertical wall the basketball still rotates clockwise. Figure 1A shows this.

 Boomerang ball (2) (The effect of the friction force FR in Q is not that large as that of FR in P, since the ball approaches the vertical wall with hpand this momentum is smaller than vpin P.) Having hit the vertical wall the ball climbs steep (see Figure 1A). A parabola-trajectory follows. On hitting the floor in R, the friction force is directed to the right (Figure 1B). The impulse rFdtis large enough to make the component hpchange direction and RMrFis inducing a counter clockwise rotation. It bounces towards S and again FR is directed to the inner side of the parabola, making the component hpreverse direction and RMrFinducing clockwise rotation. And so on.    
<b> Remarks: </b>  
  Practicing this demonstration against a real wall will learn that this part of the demonstration can also be appreciated on its own. Having the right speed and right angle, a very high climbing ball will be the result of your practicing. Figure 1A shows the explanation of this phenomenon: After bouncing at Q, vp has a very high value.  A nice variation to this demonstration is the "drunken student" (sorry, "drunken sailor"). To throw a ball that follows such a staggering trajectory, see Figure 2.
