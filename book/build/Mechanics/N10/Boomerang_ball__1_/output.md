<b> Equipment: </b>  
  Superball.  Basketball.  Table.   
<b> Safety: </b>  
  A superball can jump into many unexpected directions, so mind vulnerable objects in your neighborhood. Boomerang ball (1)
    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The superball is thrown under the table as shown in the Diagram. Surprisingly it bounces back to the pitcher! How is this possible?   
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 As an introduction to an explanation a basketball is rolled over the floor, hitting the wall and rolling back to you. But in this rolling back it is also bouncing up and down (see the demonstration “What force makes that ball bounce?” in this database). Confronting your students with the question "where originates this vertical momentum?" will lead them (I hope) to the answer: "the impulse of the friction force while the ball touches the vertical wall".  As a second introduction to an explanation the basketball is thrown as shown in Figure 1A

 Boomerang ball (1) (Also see the demonstration "Throwing a basketball" in this database). The ball is thrown without rotation, but after bouncing it rotates (the lines on the basktball make this erotationThe cause for this rotation is the torque very well visible). M, due to the friction force  (see Figure 1B). :()rFMrFrrF, that acts during a certain time t, also causes a decrease of the momentum (ph) in the horizontal direction of the moving ball (0thRpFdt). The result is that, after hitting the floor, the ball not only rotates but also rises at a steeper angle than it had in its approach. (See Figure 1C; pv only reverses its direction and does not change its magnitude; suppose the bounce completely elastic). Figure 2 shows the ball on hitting the bottom-side of the table-top. Observing the movement of the ball's surface with respect to the bottom-side of the tabletop makes clear that the friction force is (again) directed to the left.

 Due to this horizontal impulse, ph even changes direction and bouncing from the bottom-
