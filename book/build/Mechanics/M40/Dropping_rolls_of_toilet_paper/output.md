## Equipment   
 
 *  Two equal rolls of toilet paper.
     
  
## Presentation   
 Two rolls of toilet paper are dropped simultaneously from the same height ( 2m), one ≈of them while holding on to the paper-end of the roll. This roll hits the floor later than the other.    
  
## Explanation   
 When you drop the toilet paper roll while holding on to one end, the roll is momentarily rotating about an axis at the edge of the roll. The angular acceleration (α) of the roll during its fall can be found from Iτα=, where the net torque is given by 2mgrτ= (see Figure 1).

 The acceleration of the center of mass (a) is related to the angular acceleration of the roll by a=αr2, so the roll accelerates downward by 22mgraI=. Since 22Imr>()2222122mImrrr⎛⎞⎜⎟=+⎜⎟+⎝⎠, we find that a < g.    
  
## Remarks   
 
 *  Working with the above formulas, it can easily be shown that 223agR=+, where 12rRr=. For our toilet rolls R=0.4, so a=0.63 g. This means that when the paper-end held roll is dropped from a height of about 1.25 m and the other roll from a height of about 2 m, both rolls hit the floor simultaneously.
