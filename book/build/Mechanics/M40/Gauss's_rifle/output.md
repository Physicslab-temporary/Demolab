# Gauss's rifle 
 Gauss's rifle   
<b> Aim: </b>  
 To show a remarkable demonstration on conservation of mechanical energy. It looks like we are gaining energy!

<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Plastic curtain-rail. 
 *  Small ceramic magnets. 
 *  Steel balls. Gauss's rifle
    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Introduction Place one steel ball on the rail. A second ball slowly rolls towards it and there is a collision. The first ball stops and the second ball rolls with a speed equal to that of the starting ball (see Figure1A). Place three steel balls on the rail, touching each other. A fourth ball rolls towards them and there is a collision. The fourth ball stops and the third ball moves away with a speed equal to that of the fourth ball (see Figure 1B).

 Gauss's rifle    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Introduction Place one steel ball on the rail. A second ball slowly rolls towards it and there is a collision. The first ball stops and the second ball rolls with a speed equal to that of the starting ball (see Figure1A). Place three steel balls on the rail, touching each other. A fourth ball rolls towards them and there is a collision. The fourth ball stops and the third ball moves away with a speed equal to that of the fourth ball (see Figure 1B).   Figure 1  Presentation A ceramic magnet is added to the setup and firmly fixed to the rail (see Figure 1C). The fourth ball slowly rolls towards the ceramic magnet, hits and ball three rolls away with a much higher speed! When in figure1C ball 4 is stuck to the magnet, the approaching ball 3 will not launch ball 4. The demonstration can be made more spectacular by placing more magnet-three-balls combinations, so that the speed increases more and more and moreâ€¦, making a rifle!(?) (see DiagramB).    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 The magnet exerts an attractive force on the steel balls. When a ball sticks to the magnet a force is needed to make it loose. In terms of potential energy the magnet is a well (see Figure2).

 Energy conservation enables a description of the begin- and end-situation (no matter how complicated the proces in between). So we give a description of ball 4 and ball 3:
