<b> Presentation: </b>  
 Watching a nutating object we observe that the body-axis makes a conical movement (see "Nutation 1" in this Database). This movement of the body-axis is visualized in our model by rotating the L-axis by hand (see Figures).

<b> Explanation: </b>  
 L, w and body-axis are in one plane. While moving, L remains fixed in space, so movement of that plane has to take place around L. The fixed cone (so-called "space cone") contains w and this w turns around L. To show the position of w with rerspect to the body axis, a cone around the body-axis (so-called body-cone) is visualized. This body-cone also contains w . So in our model the position of w is seen where the two cones touch each other. While rotating, the movement of the body-axis around L (nutation) and the movement of the momentary rotation-axis  (w) around the symmetry-axis can be observed.    
<b> Remarks: </b>  
 
 *  The model is made in such a way that the two cones grip each other (teeth on the inside of the rim of the body-cone grip the wooden bars of the space-cone), so that the cones are not slipping. This is needed since there is only one w while in our model w is in two cones. 
 *  Our model represents the movement of a disk-shaped nutating object (I3>I1). Visualizing of a nutating bar-shaped object (I1>I3) needs a model having the body-cone revolving with its outside around a fixed space-cone.
