 *  rotating platform 
 *  support rods and clamps 
 *  rotatable (hinged) clamp Precession (3b)
    
  
## Presentation   
 The bicyclewheel with handles is vertically mounted on a rotating platform in such a way that one handle is fixed in a hinged clamp and the other handle rests on a support (see diagram). The bicycle wheel is made fast spinning. Now the rotating platform is slowly turned round by hand, trying both directions of rotation. In one direction of rotation, the spinning bicyclewheel will lift its free handle upwards from the support. As soon as you stop speeding up the rotating platform, the lifting of the spinning bicyclewheel will stop also. Leaving the spinning bicyclewheel to itself now, it slowly comes down, and the rotating platform speeds up.    
  
## Explanation   
 The spinning bicyclewheel has an angular momentum of I1w0. Rotating the platform, introduces a torque T. This torque tends to change I1w0, so I1w0 moves into the direction of T. So, when T is pointing upward, I1w0 moves upward: the bicyclewheel-handle lifts itself from the support. (See Figure 1.)

 Figure 2  While the platform is freely rotating, gravitational torque mgs is acting (see Figure 2). In Figure 2 this torque is pointing out to the reader. I1w0 moves into the direction of mgs, keeping the platform rotating (precession). In this process, increases because the bicyclewheel is coming down. Since 00pmgsIww=, wp increases due to s becoming larger (and also a little due to w0 becoming smaller).    
  
## Remarks   
 
 *  Our setup is in such a way that s changes substantially when the wheel comes down. When our wheel is at about 45o, s=0. 
 *  Take care that the bicyclewheel is not lifted more than 45o, because then it surpasses the hinge and falls down to the other side, slamming the support-rods and clamps!
