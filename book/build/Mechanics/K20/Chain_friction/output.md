## Presentation   
 The chain is laid out straight on a table. One end is slowly pulled over the edge until the chain just does not slip. The coefficient of friction ()sbetween the table top and chain is then00slll, where l is the total length of the chain and  the length of 0lthe overhanging portion.    
  
## Explanation   
 No slipping means that forces are in equilibrium: 1FF2 (see Figure 1). 0ll2F0l1F

 The mass of the part of the chain hanging over the edge equals:01lmlm. This makes:0l01lFmlg. The mass of the part of the chain still on the table equals:02llmlm. The normal force of that part of the chain equals:0NllFmgl. 02sNsllFFmlg. 12FF now yields:0slllmgmgll0, and so:00slll.   
  
## Remarks   
 
 *  It is advisable to make the corner of the table a low friction surface, e.g. rounding that corner. You can of course also make a special surface for your chain (acrylic plate,bended at one end). We used a stand bar as a low friction surface for the corner of the table. 
 *  Instead of a chain, the demonstration can also be done with a piece of soft cloth or rope.
