## Equipment   
 
 *  Wooden block 
 *  Pulley 
 *  String 
 *  Slotted masses
     
  
## Presentation   
 The slotted mass is made so heavy that the block just doesnâ€™t move. Then you give a smash on the table and the block will start sliding and keep on sliding.    
  
## Explanation   
 When the block just doesn't move, it means that Ff is almost equal to Ff,max=mstatFn (see Figure 1).

``` 
 A smash on the table means that the block is released from the table for a short moment (at least temporarily Fn will be much smaller than mAg) so A and B start moving. Since A and B continue to move, it means that mkinFn (=mBg) is lower than mstatFn.    
  
## Remarks   
 
 *  The ring for fixing the string can be moved vertically in order to maintain the pulling string horizontal when the block is moving. 
 *  A wetted bottom of the block makes this demonstration somewhat easier.
