## Equipment   
 
 *  Platform with grid, used as reference. 
 *  Ruler, 1m. 
 *  Stick. Percussionpoint (1)
    
  
## Presentation   
 1. Place the ruler with its centerline on the thick centerline of the grid (see Diagram). With the stick you give a short blow to the center of the stick (a movement like you are playing pool-billiards). There will result a translation of the stick. 2. Again place the ruler with its centerline on the grid. With the stick you give a short blow to the ruler e.g. at 60cm. There will result a translation and rotation of the stick. 3. With the stick you give a short blow to the ruler at 100cm. There will result a translation and rotation of the stick. Special is that it rotates around the point of 33cm on the ruler. 4. With the stick you give a short blow to the ruler at 67cm. There will result a translation and rotation of the stick. Special is that it rotates around the beginning of the stick.  The point, around whioch the stick rotates is called "percussionpoint". In Presentation3 and -4, this point is on the stick; in Presentation2 it is outside the stick.    
  
## Explanation   
 Due to the short blow, the ruler performs a movement that can be considered as consisting of two movements: a translation and rotation around its center of mass CM (see Figure1).

 During the short blow force acts on the ruler. The total momentum of this force is Fdtp=âˆ«. The ruler gets a speed vc, so the momentum of the ruler is mvc. This makes vc=p/m. Relative to CM the ruler has also an angular momentum Icwc=bp (see Figure2). So wc=bp/Ic. On one side of CM, vc and wc have the same direction; on the other side vc and wc are   Percussionpoint (1)

 opposite to each other. Looking at point A:Accvvxw=-. When point A remains at rest after the blow (A is then the socalled percussion point) then0ccvxw=-. This happens atccccvIpmxbpImbw===. For this ruler: Ic=1/12ml2, making2112lxb=. Applying this to the different situations of the Presentation shows the observed percussion points: in Presentation1 (b=0), -3 (b=.5m) and -4 (b=.17m). In Presentation2 (b=.1m), the percussion point is outside the ruler (x=.83m).    
  
## Remarks   
 
 *  Playing billiards with a stick instead with a ball needs practice!
