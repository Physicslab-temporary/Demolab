 Rugbyball    
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The rugbyball lies on the floor. By hand it is given a fast spin around its short axis (see Figure1).   Figure 1  When the ball has made some turns it lifts itself, finally standing on its nose (tail) and rotating around its long axis.    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 • When the ball turns around its short axis (ws ) it will tilt its long axis a little due to unbalanced mass distribution. Then spinning around its long axis (wl ) will start (see Figure2) and at the same time, the long axis starts a precession (I2wl moves into the direction of Tp ).

 • The point of contact slips on the floor (see Diagram). The frictionforce (Ff ) on the ball is pointing in the same direction as its direction of precession. The torque (Tf ) of this frictionforce is pointing upward (see Diagram), almost perpendicular to I2wl . So the frictionforce gives a torque that erects the ball (I2wl moves into the direction of Tf ). • See also the demonstrations "Precession 3a" and "Precession 3b" in this database where it is shown how a precessing object reacts to an applied torque.   
<b> Remarks: </b>  
 • Friction between ball and floor must be high enough to make this demonstration successful. • This demonstration can also be done with a hardboiled egg. Doing it on my kitchentable, the angular speed of the egg must be quite high to reach thje lifting effect.
