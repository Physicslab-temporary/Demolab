 As a result the rounded stem of the top is attempting to roll over the floor in two ways: one due to the spin of the top around its body-axis and the other due to precession driving the stem over the floor. The first way is much faster than the second and so the rounded stem slips: it slips into the direction of spin. The frictionforce on the stem in point C is opposite to the slip, so friction is directed backwards (see Figure 1b). The torque of this frictionforce (Tf ) is almost perpendicular to I0w0 , so I0w0 continues to rise until the top is positioned vertical (Tf will tend to align Iowo ). The orientation of the top follows that of Iowo , and the top rights itself. Once perfectly vertical the frictionforce is no longer present, but any disturbance moving the top away from the vertical immediately introduces a raising torque again, restoring its vertical position. While moving to the vertical the track of precession will have a smaller radius of curvature, so while raising, we will see a converging spiral ending in a point. Due to dissipation the spin of the top is slowed down and a point will be reached when slipping stops. Consequently the raising torque is no longer present: the top topples.
    
<b> Remarks: </b>  
 
 *  Tops having a large radius of curvature have more trouble to rise to the vertical. (They loose too much energy while slipping before reaching the vertical.) 
 *  When you have enough experience throwing the top with the felt-pen you can make it turn on an overrhead-projector, so a large group of students can see the spiral-movement. 
 *  See also the demonstrations "Precession 3a" and "Precession 3b" in this database where it is shown how a precessing object reacts to an
 applied torque.
