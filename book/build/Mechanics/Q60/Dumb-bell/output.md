<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Dumbbell pivoted on a support at a non-symmetry axis through the center of mass. 
 *  Frame in order to lift off the dumbbell from the support
     
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The dumbbell is placed on top of the support. A thread is fixed to the center of mass and thrown over the top of the frame and hold slack, away from the dumbbell. The dumbbell is given a rotation by hand. Make the students observe that the two masses of the rotating dumbbell describe two horizontal circles (Figure1a).

 Lift the dumbbell from its support. Almost immediately it can be seen that now the rotation of the dumbbell takes place in one slanting plane (Figure1b). Before lift-off it can be seen that while the dumbbell rotates, the vertical support shaft oscillates/shakes/wobbles strongly and yet it is a thick and strong steel shaft!      
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 The dumbbell-shaped object rotates about a non-symmetry axis through the center of mass O. Figure2a shows the angular momentum vector of the rotating dumbbell relative to O at the instant drawn and while the dumbbell rotates the angular momentum vector describes a cone .So the angular momentum changes direction continuously. To do this a torque is needed. The ballbearing support at O gives that torque: A centripetal force Fc is needed to move m around in a circle (see Figure2b). This needs a torque cFrÂ·(cid:1)(cid:1). (Also dLMdt=(cid:1)(cid:1) gives this result.)

 Figure2  This torque also makes the support shaft wobble. The dumbbell needs to rotate in such a way as the direction of L(cid:1)dictates at the moment of lift-off.    
<b> Remarks: </b>  
 
 *  The wobbling of the supportshaft can also be described in terms of dynamical unbalance: The angular momentum (L(cid:1)) and the angular velocity (w(cid:1)) are not parallel.
