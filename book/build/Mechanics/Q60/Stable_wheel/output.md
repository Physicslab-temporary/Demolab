<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Small bicycle wheel; diam. = 40cm (or any other wheel or disc).
     
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 • Place the wheel upright on the floor. On release it falls down immediately. • Then the wheel is released while turning. It rolls over the floor and remains upright for a much longer time. The second observation made is that it will follow a curve when it starts falling down. Also notice that the curve it makes, is into the direction of the "falling-down" (see Figure1).

<b> Explanation: </b>  
 Figure2A shows the wheel turning. The rotation is indicated by means of the vector w. Due to some disturbance, the wheel inclines due to gravity: a torque (t) is acting on the wheel (see Figure2B).

 Due to this torque the direction of the vector w is changed: w is changed into the    direction of t (see figure2C), so the wheel will make a curve while rolling. This continues because the vectors w and t remain perpendicular to each other. Also can be seen now that the larger the inclination, the sharper the curve it will make since the vector r increases, making t larger.
