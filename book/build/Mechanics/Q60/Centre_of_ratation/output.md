 *  Beamer to project image of square grid. Centre of rotation
     
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The two spheres connected to each other by means of the light stick are balanced (see Diagram) to show where the centre of mass (CM) is located. As can be observed, the location of the CM divides the distance (d) between the two centres of the spheres in 1/3d and 2/3d. Then the system of the two spheres connected by the rubber band is taken. The rubber band is twisted (see Diagram and Remarks). The system is placed on the board with the grid and then left by itself. The combination starts to rotate while unwinding the twisted rubber band. As can be observed, the combination rotates around its CM.    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 1. The total mass is located at the CM. No external forces are acting, so the CM has to remain at its position on the board as Newton's first law tells us. (When the system should rotate around any other point but the CM, the CM performs a rotation and an external torque should be needed for that.)

 Centre of rotation   2. When the body rotates it does so around an axis perpendicular to d. When no external forces are acting, the angular momentum vector L(cid:1)remains constant. The body in our demonstration consists of two masses: m1 and m2 (see Figure1a). 12LLL=+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1); 111222LRmvRmv=·+·(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1). The axis of rotation characterizes itself by the fact that, at any position on this axis, L(cid:1)will have the same magnitude and direction (at O' the horizontal components of L1a and L2a cancel, and their vertical components add up toL(cid:1): see Sources). This means that only one axis of rotation is possible. When, for instance, an axis of rotation is chosen passing through the centre of m1, then the total angular momentum adds up to L2b (see Figure1b). And so, being constant in magnitude, its direction constantly changes (describing a cone). Such a situation needs an external torque. In our demonstration, there is no external torque and the two sphere-system rotates around an axis somewhere between the two spheres (Figure2). At O, 111222LRmvRmv=·+·(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1), directed along the axis of rotation. At O', the horizontal components of L1 and L2 need to cancel in order to keep L along the axis of rotation. 1111cosRmvLa=(cid:1) 111111111sintancoskRmvLRmvmvyaaa=== In the same way: 222kLmvy=. v=wR, so 111kLmRyw=and 222kLmRyw=. These two are equal when m1R1=m2R2, and this is so when the axis of rotation passes through the CM.
