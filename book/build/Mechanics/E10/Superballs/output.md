# Superballs 
    
<b> Aim: </b>  
 Showing that when a superball of small mass resting on top of a superball of large mass is dropped from a low height, the small ball ideally rebounds to nearly nine times its original height.

 *  1 superball of large mass (basketball). 
 *  1 superball of small mass (table-tennis ball). 
 *  ("Astro-superball".)
     
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 A superball of small mass is dropped and rebounces almost to the original dropping-height. Next the superball of small mass is held about 10cm above the superball of large mass. This combination is dropped simultaneously and now, after striking the floor, the small ball takes off and can reach a height nine times as high as the original dropping-height.    
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 Just before striking the floor both balls have a velocity v. Just after the combination hits the floor, the ball of large mass moves up with a veloctiy v whereas the ball of small mass is still moving down with a velocity v, making the two balls relative speed 2v. So, the ball of small mass is approaching the ball of large mass with a velocity of 2v. When the collision is elastic, the velocity of the ball of small mass after the collision is again 2v, but now in the opposite direction. So the ball of small mass moves away from the ball of large mass with a velocity 2v. Relative to the floor, the ball of large mass moves up with a velocity v, so the ball of small mass moves up with a velocity 3v relative to the floor.

    The small ball would have gone up with a velocity v if it had just hit the floor, but now it takes off with a velocity 3v. Because mgh=Â½mv2, a 3 times higher take-off velocity means that it goes 9 times higher.
