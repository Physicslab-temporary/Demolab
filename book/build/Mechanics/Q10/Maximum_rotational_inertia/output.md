## Equipment   
 
 *  Electric hand drill (or other electric motor). 
 *  Aluminium bar f 12mm, l=180mm with string l=200mm. 
 *  A rope, l=500mm. 
 *  A chain, l=500mm. 
 *  Transparent screen
     
  
## Presentation   
 The bar hung from a string is fixed to the drill and set spinning. The bar starts to rotate and will not remain vertical, but rises. Finally, the bar spins in a horizontal plane (see Diagram). A rope suspended in the drills head will climb very fast to a rotation in a horizontal plane (passing through an interesting sequence of movement). When a chain is used, this chain will also finally rotate in a horizontal plane, but it takes much more time to go from the vertical suspension to the horizontal rotation. (Now a study of the sequence in between is possible.) Figure1 shows several objects that can be used in this demonstration.

## Explanation   
 
 *  When the vertical bar is just a little out of its equilibrium, then due to opposing centripetal forces on the upper and lower part of the bar, the bar will eventually align itself horizontally. 
 *  The angular velocity vector w points vertically downward. The angular vector momentum does not, because the rotational inertia of the bar is greater about an axis perpendicular to the bar. The downward impulse LtD(cid:1)attempts to align the angular momentum with w.
    
  
## Remarks   
 
 *  While rotating the bar, rope or chain, take care that these objects, while rotating horizontally, leave enough free space. A transparent screen between the rotating objects and the observers is ad
vised.
