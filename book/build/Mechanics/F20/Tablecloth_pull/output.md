## Presentation   
 Set the table as shown in Diagram (light a candle etc.). Our tablecloth is not really a tablecloth. We use a sheet of paper (see Diagram).  Take the protruding free end of the paper in both hands and give a sharp downward jerk. The sheet of paper comes out from under the glasses and they are hardly moved. (Even the water in the glasses is not disturbed!)   
  
## Explanation   
 This is one of the many possible demonstrations to show the validity of Newton's first law.  Also Newton's second law can be used to explain this demonstration: The effect of a given force between the sheet of paper and the glasses depend on the impulse of that force (FΔt). The impulse is small when the sheet of paper moves away quickly (Δt is small). The resulting horizontal displacement will then be very small. Analysis shows that the horizontal displacement d of a mass on the sheet equals: 2111221kdkgtk⎛⎞=Δ+⎜⎟⎝⎠, where k1 is the coefficient of friction between sheet and glass and k2 is the coefficient of friction between glass and table and Δt the time to pull the sheet from beneath the glasses. So d is very sensitive to Δt !   
  
## Remarks   
 
 *  After lecture students like to try the demonstration by themselves. 
 *  This demonstration needs trying it before you show it!
