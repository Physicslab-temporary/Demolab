   Fiigure 1.  Acceleration along the ramp: The centrifugal force (FC) acting on the ball is given by F=mRC2 (R being the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the center of the ball). The force on the ball along the ramp is sincosrFmg (see figure 1). So: 2cosrFkmR. When rolling down, R reduces, but at the same time  increases: L=I=constant; I=mR2, so: mR=L2, 2LmR. This gives for Fr: 3rCFkR When R is large, Fr is small and the acceleration along the ramp will be small. When R is small, Fr is large and the acceleration along the ramp will be large (see points 1 and 2 of the 'extra' presentation). It can also happen that the ball moves down the ramp 'too much', due to its linear inertia along the ramp. Then the rotation of the platform speeds up that much that due to the increase in centrifugal force the ball moves upwards again! Then the ball 'oscillates' down the ramp (see point 3 of the 'extra' presentation).   
<b> Remarks: </b>  
 It is necessary to carefully level the platform before performing the demonstration. If the rotating platform is not level, the performance will be substantially affected.
