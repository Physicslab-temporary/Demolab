<b> Equipment: </b>  
 
 *  Racquetball. 
 *  Racquetball with straws (Diagram C). 
 *  Superball (see Explanation). 
 *  Basketball (see Explanation). 
 *  Camera 
 *  Beamer, to project the image of the bouncing ball to a large audience.
     
<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The racquetball is dropped straight down from your hand and bounces back (see drawing A in Diagram). This is a well known phenomenon. The laws of mechanics explain the reversal of the velocity (see Figure 1).

<b> Presentation: </b>  
 The racquetball is dropped straight down from your hand and bounces back (see drawing A in Diagram). This is a well known phenomenon. The laws of mechanics explain the reversal of the velocity (see Figure 1).   Figure 1  There is a strong correspondence between the formalisms of translational and rotational mechanics. Awareness of this correspondence leads us to the prediction that when the bouncing ball is spinning in one direction when dropped, it has to spin in the opposite direction after bouncing! (see drawing B in Diagram.) We try this and it really works that way! (The camera looks down on the bouncing ball and "sees" the label on the ball rotate in one direction and after bouncing in the other direction, and so on, while bouncing.)   
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 Figure 2 shows the explanation from a point of view of rotational dynamics. In order to perform this demonstration you really need a racquetball.

 When, for instance, you use a superball, the ball continues to rotate in the same direction after bouncing. In order to get a reversal of the sense of rotation it is wise to study again the correspondence between translational and rotational laws:
