# Bicycle wheel and swivel chair 
    
<b> Aim: </b>  
  To show conservation of angular momentum.  To clarify the vector characteristics of angular momentum. (In this demonstration especially the direction of angular momentum is important.)

<b> Equipment: </b>  
  Swivel-chair.  Bicycle wheel with handles and leaded rim.   
<b> Safety: </b>  
  When handling the bicycle wheel for the first time, practice with it standing firmly on the ground and not on the swivel-chair, because the direction of the experienced forces might take you by surprise and hurt you.  When you want to stop the bicycle wheel, slowing it down to a stop with your hand, be careful not to burn your hand.     
<b> Explanation: </b>  
 1. Making the wheel turn, it obtains an angular velocity  and an angular momentum L=I.

<b> Explanation: </b>  
 1. Making the wheel turn, it obtains an angular velocity  and an angular momentum L=I.  Figure 1 Then the swivel chair has to turn in the opposite sense with an angular velocity ', whose angular momentum equals -I (see Figure 1b), because the total angular momentum of the system has to remain zero as it is in the beginning of the demonstration (Figure 1a).  2. The wheel has an angular momentum of L=I (see Figure 2a). This angular momentum is conserved, so when the wheel stops, the swivel chair with demonstrator will start to rotate (see' in Figure 2b) in the same direction as . ab

    3. When the rotating wheel has its axis in horizontal position (Figure 3a), then there is no angular momentum in the vertical direction. The swivel chair is not rotating. Turning the wheel 90º upwards (Figure 3b), then an angular momentum is introduced in the vertical direction (I. This has to be compensated by another angular momentum of the same amount (-I in order to keep the total angular momentum in the vertical direction zero: the swivel chair and demonstrator will rotate (' in Figure 3b).                                           Bringing the wheel down (see Figure 3c) will make the swivel chair turn into the other direction.                                                                               (The disappearance of I in the horizontal direction has no rotating effect, because the set up cannot rotate around a horizontal axis. The only effect is a torque felt by the demonstrator.)  a c

 4. In the beginning the wheel is turning, so there is an amount of angular momentum: L=I and the swivel chair is standing still (see Figure 4a). Bringing the rotating wheel to a horizontal position removes that angular momentum from the system, but since angular momentum needs to be conserved, the whole system starts rotating (' ) in the same direction as  When the wheel is lowered once more (Figure 4c), the figure makes clear that the swivel chair has to speed op to 2   a b c

 5. This is repeating the procedure of situation 4 a number of times. In the beginning the swivel chair is not rotating. At the end of the first round it rotates with 2Then after the second run it rotates with 4after the third run with 6and so on.   
<b> Remarks: </b>  
  After the demonstration we have more bicycle wheels and swivel chairs in our lecture hall so the students can practice themselves and experience those ‘strange’ forces/torques.
