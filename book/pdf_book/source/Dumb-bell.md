Equipment:

- Dumbbell pivoted on a support at a non-symmetry axis through the center of mass.
- Frame in order to lift off the dumbbell from the support


## Dumb-bell

Presentation: The dumbbell is placed on top of the support. A thread is fixed to the center of mass and thrown over the top of the frame and hold slack, away from the dumbbell. The dumbbell is given a rotation by hand. Make the students observe that the two masses of the rotating dumbbell describe two horizontal circles (Figure1a).

Figure 1

Lift the dumbbell from its support. Almost immediately it can be seen that now the rotation of the dumbbell takes place in one slanting plane (Figure1b).

Before lift-off it can be seen that while the dumbbell rotates, the vertical support shaft oscillates/shakes/wobbles strongly and yet it is a thick and strong steel shaft!

## Dumb-bell

Explanation: The dumbbell-shaped object rotates about a non-symmetry axis through the center of mass O. Figure2a shows the angular momentum vector of the rotating dumbbell relative to $\mathrm{O}$ at the instant drawn and while the dumbbell rotates the angular momentum vector describes a cone .So the angular momentum changes direction continuously. To do this a torque is needed. The ballbearing support at O gives that torque: A centripetal force $F_{c}$ is needed to move $m$ around in a circle (see Figure2b). This needs a torque $\vec{F}_{c} \times \vec{r}$. (Also $\vec{M}=\frac{d \vec{L}}{d t}$ gives this result.)

Figure2

This torque also makes the support shaft wobble. The dumbbell needs to rotate in such a way as the direction of $\vec{L}$ dictates at the moment of lift-off.

Remarks:

- The wobbling of the supportshaft can also be described in terms of dynamical unbalance: The angular momentum ( $\vec{L}$ ) and the angular velocity $(\vec{\omega})$ are not parallel.
