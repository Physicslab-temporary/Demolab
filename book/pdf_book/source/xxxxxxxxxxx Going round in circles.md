Equipment:

- Tube, with rounded edges, $\mathrm{I}=15 \mathrm{~cm}$.
- Piece of rope, $I=1.5 \mathrm{~m}$.
- Two rubber stoppers $\left(m_{1}\right)$.
- A number of weights ( $\left.m_{2}\right)$. We use thick washers.
- Paperclip.
- (Stopwatch).


## Gauss's law

Presentation: Diagram shows the components and how to use them. Swinging the tube a little makes the mass $m_{1}$ go round in circles above your head. The demonstrator needs to make $m_{1}$ go round at a certain frequency to balance the system.

Figure 1

- When he slows down to a lower frequency $m_{2}$ will move down, making the circle of $\mathrm{m}_{1}$ smaller and smaller. Speeding up makes $\mathrm{m}_{2}$ go upward and $\mathrm{m}_{1}$ goes round in larger and larger circles.
- The demonstrator makes $m_{1}$ go round in a stable circle. Then he grabs $m_{2}$ and pulls it downwards. $\mathrm{m}_{1}$ speeds up dramatically, going round in smaller and smaller circles.

If time permits the relationship between the variables in this demonstration can be verified more exactly.

Just below the tubing a paperclip is fixed to the rope used as a marker to make $\mathrm{m}_{1}$ go round in a circle with fixed R. A stopwatch can be used to time the frequency.

1. When $\mathrm{m}_{1}$ is doubled by adding another rubber stopper to it, a lower frequency is needed to balance the system.
2. When $\mathrm{m}_{2}$ is increased, a higher frequency is needed to balance the system.
3. When half the rope length is used (shifting the paperclip) a higher frequency is needed to balance the system.

## Gauss's law

Explanation: Analysis shows that movement at a constant speed ( $v$ ) of a mass ( $m_{1}$ ) in a circle with radius $R$ can be described by $a_{c}=\frac{v^{2}}{r} \omega^{2} R$. In our demonstration the tension ( $T$ ) in the string provides the force needed for $a_{c}: T=m_{1} a_{c}$, and $m_{2} g=m_{1} a_{c} \Rightarrow a_{c}=\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}} g$, (see Figure2).

Figure 2

- First, the demonstrator showed a balanced situation. Then he slowed down $\omega$. The centripetal acceleration, describing such a slower movement, will be lower $\left(a_{c}=\omega^{2} R\right.$ ). But $T$ is a fixed value, so $T$ will pull $m_{1}$ inwardly. As $a_{c}=\omega^{2} R$ shows, this proces is cumulative and $m_{1}$ ends at the centre of the circle.
- When $m_{2}$ is pulled downwards, the stringtension increases substantially and so $a_{c}$ will. According to $a_{c}=\omega^{2} R$ and seeing that $R$ decreases, wincreases much.

1. Doubling $m_{1}$ means that the provided $a_{c}$ by the tension of the string will be halved $\left(a_{c}=\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}} g\right.$ ). To make $m_{1}$ still go round in the same circle $\omega$ has to be a factor $\sqrt{2}$ lower $\left(a_{c}=\omega^{2} R\right)$.
2. Increasing $m_{2}$ will make the string tension higher and so the provided $a_{c}$ is higher ( $T=m_{1} a_{c}$ ). To make $m_{1}$ still go in the same circle, whas to increase.
3. When $R$ is halved. The tension in the string has remained the same, so the provided $a_{c}$ has remained the same. To make $m_{1}$ still go in a (smaller) circle, whas to increase a factor $\sqrt{2}\left(a_{c}=\omega^{2} R\right)$.

Remarks:

- Practice the demonstration before you show it. A practiced hand is needed to make $\mathrm{m}_{1}$ go round properly.
- We use rubber stoppers as masses moving around in circles for safety reasons.
- The spinning mass should be light compared to the hanging weight (about a factor 3), because otherwise the angle between the string and the vertical does not approach $90^{\circ}$ : there will be more friction and due to the slanting rope (making a cone of our circle) the analysis becomes a different one.
- In the last part of the presentation (grabbing and pulling $m_{2}$ downwards) the demonstrator will feel that quite a lot of force is needed. It is of course most instructive for the students if they feel this force themselves (during coffeebreak?).
