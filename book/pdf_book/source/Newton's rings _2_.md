## Equipment:

- Newton's rings apparatus (convex lens pressed against flat glass plate (Duboscq); pressure can be adjusted by screws in the ring-mount).
- Hg-lamp, with power-unit.
- Objective lens.
- Two lenses $\mathrm{f}=150 \mathrm{~mm} /$ diam. $=70 \mathrm{~mm}$.
- Flat surface mirror.
- Black screen.


## Newton's rings (2)

Safety:

- The Hg-lamp needs some time to come to its full light intensity. It also becomes very hot! Do not touch it.

Presentation: Set up the equipment as shown in Diagram. Images are projected on the wall (see Figure 1A).

Figure 1

After the lamp is heated up, situation of Diagram A is presented to the students, to indicate that there will be a reflected and a transmitted beam of light. Then the transmitted beam is blocked (black screen) and using the mirror and a $+150 \mathrm{~mm}$-lens the reflection image is projected (Diagram B). Clearly Newton's rings are observed. Observe the central dark spot (see also: Remarks) observe the colored rings, the color-sequence and observe the diminishing distance between the rings when moving away from the centre. Changing the pressure on the Newton's rings apparatus will change/move the reflected image. Then the black screen is removed and using the second $+150 \mathrm{~mm}$-lens the transmitted image is projected next to the reflected image (see Diagram C and Figure 1). It is clearly visible that both images are complementary.

At first glance, the observed colors look rainbowlike, but careful observation shows that it differs from a rainbow (see Figure 2; reality is much better than this photograph).

Figure 2

Observing the reflected image shows, when moving away from the central dark spot, at first a rainbow, but already in the next ring the color purple appears; in the next rings white and orange are dominating; around ring 10 there is a repeating sequence of blue and orange and around ring 16 repeating bands of dark violet and yellowish rings are visible giving form a distance the impression of a continuity of black and white fringes.

Explanation: See Figure1 B. Looking at the two red rays drawn in this figure, we see that it is the height $d$ that introduces the phasedifference. $d=R-\left(R^{2}-x^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}$.

The two rays, one reflecting from the hemisphere and the other reflecting from the plane, will have a phasedifference of $\Delta \phi=k(2 d)-\pi$ ( $\pi$ at reflection off the plane).

Maximum, constructive interference will occur at $\Delta \varphi=\frac{4 \pi d}{\lambda}-\pi=m 2 \pi$, so when $d=1 / 2 \lambda(m+1 / 2)$.

This result translated to the distance $x$ (because $x$ lies in the plane we are watching/projecting) yields $1 / 2 \lambda(m+1 / 2)=R-\left(R^{2}-x^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}$, giving $x=\{\lambda R(m+1 / 2)$ $\left.1 / 4 \lambda^{2}(m+1 / 2)^{2}\right\}^{1 / 2}$. And $R$ being much larger than $\lambda$ will give $x=\{\lambda R(m+1 / 2)\}^{1 / 2}$. First conclusion is that $x$ is proportional to the squareroot of wavelength. So a higher wavelength yields a higher $x$. blue is on the inside, red on the outside. Second, the proportionality in $(m+1 / 2)^{1 / 2}$ shows that the sequence of the bright fringes follows a square root: moving away from the centre the fringes come closer and closer together.

Figure 3

Finally, we calculated for a number of $m$-values $x$. Figure 3 shows the calculated results ( $10^{-5} ; \mathrm{R}=1 \mathrm{~m}$ ) for the red, green and blue line of $\mathrm{H}_{0}$-light. In this way it is clear that the colours observed are the result of different combinations. Only near the centre a rainbow pattern appears.

It is not difficult now to show that for destructive interference we get $x=(\lambda R \mathrm{~m})^{1 / 2}$. This yields that the centre of the reflected Newton's rings must be a dark spot. Figure3 shows the minima as dashed lines for red, green and blue.

## Remarks:

- Using filters, it is possible to show a monochromatic interference pattern. Especially in the yellow line of $\mathrm{Hg}$ the pattern is bright.
- In the projected reflection image the central area should be dark. But usually there is a coloured spot instead. This is probably due to trapped dirt in the contact area between the two surfaces.
