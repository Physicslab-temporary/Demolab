Equipment:

- Two carts, easy rolling and able to carry a human being; construction as shown in Diagram.
- Large funnel (outlet reduced to $4 \mathrm{~mm}$ ), suspended by three cords.
- Clamping material to support the funnel-pendulum.
- $1 \mathrm{~kg}$ of salt.
- Broom.

Presentation:

- One person sits on the cart and fills the funnel with salt, keeping the outlet closed with a finger and gives the funnel-pendulum a deflection into the $x^{\prime}$ direction. The demonstrator moves the cart with constant speed along the front of the lecture hall ( $y$-direction). As soon as the speed is constant, the person on the cart makes the pendulum go. A salt-track is written on the floor of the lecturehall (see Figure2). This track shows the recording of the movement of the swinging funnel in the $x$-y plane.

Figure 2

- The same demonstration is performed but now with the funnel-pendulum swinging into the $y^{\prime}$-direction. A second salt-track appears on the floor (see Figure1).

Again the salttrack shows the recording of the movement of the swinging funnel in the $x$-y plane.

The results are discussed.

Remarks:

Sources:

- The pendulum moves in the $x^{\prime}-y^{\prime}-z^{\prime}$-frame according to: $x^{\prime}=A \sin (\omega t+\phi)$; $y^{\prime}=0 ; z^{\prime}=0$. The writing on the ground in salt is in the $x-y-z$-frame. The $x^{\prime}-y^{\prime}-z^{\prime}-$ frame moves with a speed $\mathrm{V}$ into the $\mathrm{y}$-direction., so a point measured in the $x^{\prime}-$ $y^{\prime}-z^{\prime}$-frame will have an $y$-coordinate: $y=V t$. (see Figure2).
- When the pendulum swings into the $y^{\prime}$-direction, the movements in the $x$-y-zframe will be: $y=V t+A \sin (\omega t+\phi) ; x=0$ and $z=0$ (see Figure1).
- As Figure1 makes clear, the difference between much - and little salt is more pronounced when $y=V t$ is steeper; that is at higher speeds of the cart.
