## Transformer

Presentation: The demonstration is set up as shown in Diagram and Figure 1.

Figure 1

The $220 \mathrm{~V}$ is switched on and the students can read on the $\mathrm{V}$-meter that in the loop around the core a voltage of around $.4 \mathrm{~V}$ is induced.

Then the demonstrator makes the wire go round the core in two loops. Again the induced voltage is read and a doubling is observed. Then make the wire go round the core three times (see Figure2). And so on, as long as the length of the wire enables it.

Figure 2

Clearly the proportionality between induced voltage and the number of turns is observed.

Explanation: When an alternating voltage $\left(E_{p}\right)$ is applied across the primary coil of a transformer and there is no flux leakage, then the emf induced in the secondary coil is given by: $E_{s}=\frac{n_{s}}{n_{p}} E_{p}$. This demonstration verifies this:

- 1 turn: $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{s}}=1 / 500(220)=.44 \mathrm{~V}$.

-2 turns: $E_{s}=2 / 500(220)=.88 \mathrm{~V}$.

- Etc.
