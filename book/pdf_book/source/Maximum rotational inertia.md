Aim: To show that an object prefers to rotate around an axis with largest moment of inertia.

Equipment:

- Electric hand drill (or other electric motor).
- Aluminium bar $\varphi 12 \mathrm{~mm}, \mathrm{I}=180 \mathrm{~mm}$ with string $\mathrm{I}=200 \mathrm{~mm}$.
- A rope, $\mathrm{I}=500 \mathrm{~mm}$.
- A chain, $\mathrm{I}=500 \mathrm{~mm}$.
- Transparent screen


## Maximum rotational inertia

Presentation: The bar hung from a string is fixed to the drill and set spinning. The bar starts to rotate and will not remain vertical, but rises. Finally, the bar spins in a horizontal plane (see Diagram).

A rope suspended in the drills head will climb very fast to a rotation in a horizontal plane (passing through an interesting sequence of movement).

When a chain is used, this chain will also finally rotate in a horizontal plane, but it takes much more time to go from the vertical suspension to the horizontal rotation. (Now a study of the sequence in between is possible.)

Figure1 shows several objects that can be used in this demonstration.

Explanation:

Remarks:

Sources:

- When the vertical bar is just a little out of its equilibrium, then due to opposing centripetal forces on the upper and lower part of the bar, the bar will eventually align itself horizontally.
- The angular velocity vector $\omega$ points vertically downward. The angular vector momentum does not, because the rotational inertia of the bar is greater about an axis perpendicular to the bar. The downward impulse $\vec{L} \Delta t$ attempts to align the angular momentum with $\omega$.
- While rotating the bar, rope or chain, take care that these objects, while rotating horizontally, leave enough free space. A transparent screen between the rotating objects and the observers is advised.
