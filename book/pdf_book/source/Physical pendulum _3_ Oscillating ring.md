Equipment:

- 2 large (steel) rings, $\varphi=600$ with knife-edge suspension.

These rings can be divided into $2 / 3$ and $1 / 3$.

- mathematical pendulum, $\mathrm{I}=600$
- meterstick


## Physical pendulum (3) Oscillating ring

Presentation: One complete ring swings in its plane at the knife-edge on its periphery. A simple pendulum whose length is equal to the diameter of the ring is suspended beside it so the equality of periods can be observed.

A second $2 / 3$-ring is made swinging. It can be observed that the ring has still the same period!

Again the same period is measured when $1 / 3$-ring is swinging

Explanation:

- For a physical pendulum, the period $T$ is given by $T=\frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{g}} \sqrt{\frac{I_{A}}{m s}}$.

If the pendulum is a complete ring, then $s=R$ (see Figure 1), $I_{A}=I_{C}+m R^{2}$ and

$I_{c}=m R^{2}$. Then $T=\frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{g}} \sqrt{2 R}$, so $I_{r}=2 R$.

So a complete ring has the same period as a mathematical pendulum of length 2R.

- If the pendulum is part of a complete ring, $I_{O}=m R^{2}$ (Figure 2). Also $I_{O}=I_{C}+m(R-$ $s)^{2}$ (C is the center of mass) and $I_{A}=I_{C}+m s^{2}$. It follows that $I_{A}=2 m R s$ and $T=\frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{g}} \sqrt{2 R}$. So again $I_{r}=2 R$.
