# Stable wheel 

Aim: To show how a rolling bicycle wheel "organizes" its stability.

Subjects: $1 Q 60$ (Rotational Stability)

Diagram:

Equipment: - Small bicycle wheel; diam. $=40 \mathrm{~cm}$ (or any other wheel or disc).

## Stable wheel

Presentation: - Place the wheel upright on the floor. On release it falls down immediately.

- Then the wheel is released while turning. It rolls over the floor and remains upright for a much longer time.

The second observation made is that it will follow a curve when it starts falling down. Also notice that the curve it makes, is into the direction of the "fallingdown" (see Figure1).

Figure 1

Explanation: Figure2A shows the wheel turning. The rotation is indicated by means of the vector $\underline{\omega}$. Due to some disturbance, the wheel inclines due to gravity: a torque ( $\tau$ ) is acting on the wheel (see Figure2B).

Due to this torque the direction of the vector $\underline{\omega}$ is changed: $\underline{\omega}$ is changed into the

direction of $\tau$ (see figure2C), so the wheel will make a curve while rolling. This continues because the vectors $\underline{\omega}$ and $\tau$ remain perpendicular to each other.

Also can be seen now that the larger the inclination, the sharper the curve it will make
