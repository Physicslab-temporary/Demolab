# Trying hard to pull differently 

Aim: To show (again) the truth of Newton's third law.

Subjects: $\quad 1 \mathrm{H} 10$ (Action and Reaction)

Diagram:

Equipment:

- Two force sensors (we use Pasco CI-6537).
- Rubber band.
- Data-acquisition via Science Workshop.
- Beamer to project the monitor screen


## Trying hard to pull differently

Presentation: On the monitor two graphs are presented for each force sensor. The software is set in such a way that one of the sensors presents - $\mathrm{F}$.

Two demonstrators take each one of the sensors. They start both pulling randomly. The display shows clearly that whatever they do, both force sensors measure the same force: $\mathrm{F}$ and $-\mathrm{F}$ (see Figure1).

Figure 1

Also when one of the demonstrators holds his force sensor without moving it, while the other demonstrator moves again randomly, then both force sensors registrate an equal $\mathrm{F}$ and $-\mathrm{F}$. The registration does not reveal which of the two demonstrators is not moving his sensor.

Explanation: Again the truth of Newton's third law is verified.
