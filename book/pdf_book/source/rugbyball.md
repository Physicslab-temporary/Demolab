## Rugbyball

Presentation: The rugbyball lies on the floor. By hand it is given a fast spin around its short axis (see Figure1).

Figure 1

When the ball has made some turns it lifts itself, finally standing on its nose (tail) and rotating around its long axis.

Explanation:

- When the ball turns around its short axis ( $\omega_{s}$ ) it will tilt its long axis a little due to unbalanced mass distribution. Then spinning around its long axis ( $\left.\omega_{/}\right)$will start (see Figure2) and at the same time, the long axis starts a precession ( $I_{2} \omega_{1}$ moves into the direction of $T_{p}$ ).

Figure 2

- The point of contact slips on the floor (see Diagram). The frictionforce $\left(F_{f}\right)$ on the ball is pointing in the same direction as its direction of precession. The torque ( $T_{f}$ ) of this frictionforce is pointing upward (see Diagram), almost perpendicular to $I_{2} \omega_{\nu}$. So the frictionforce gives a torque that erects the ball ( $I_{2} \omega /$ moves into the direction of $T_{f}$ ).
- See also the demonstrations "Precession 3a" and "Precession 3b" in this database where it is shown how a precessing object reacts to an applied torque.

Remarks:

- Friction between ball and floor must be high enough to make this demonstration successful.
- This demonstration can also be done with a hardboiled egg. Doing it on my kitchentable, the angular speed of the egg must be quite high to reach thje lifting effect.
