## Equipment:

- Sheet of paper
- Different objects placed on the sheet of paper.


## Tablecloth pull

Presentation: Set the table as shown in Diagram (light a candle etc.). Our tablecloth is not really a tablecloth. We use a sheet of paper (see Diagram).

Take the protruding free end of the paper in both hands and give a sharp downward jerk. The sheet of paper comes out from under the glasses and they are hardly moved. (Even the water in the glasses is not disturbed!)

Explanation: This is one of the many possible demonstrations to show the validity of Newton's first law.

Also Newton's second law can be used to explain this demonstration:

The effect of a given force between the sheet of paper and the glasses depend on the impulse of that force ( $F \Delta t)$. The impulse is small when the sheet of paper moves away quickly ( $\Delta t$ is small). The resulting horizontal displacement will then be very small. Analysis shows that the horizontal displacement $d$ of a mass on the sheet equals:

$d=\frac{1}{2} k_{1} g \Delta t^{2}\left(1+\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}}\right)$, where $k_{1}$ is the coefficient of friction between sheet and glass and $k_{2}$ is the coefficient of friction between glass and table and $\Delta t$ the time to pull the sheet from beneath the glasses. So $d$ is very sensitive to $\Delta t$ !

Remarks:

- After lecture students like to try the demonstration by themselves.
