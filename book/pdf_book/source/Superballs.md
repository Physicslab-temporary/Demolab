## Superballs

Presentation: A superball of small mass is dropped and rebounces almost to the original droppingheight. Next the superball of small mass is held about $10 \mathrm{~cm}$ above the superball of large mass. This combination is dropped simultaneously and now, after striking the floor, the small ball takes off and can reach a height nine times as high as the original droppingheight.

Explanation: Just before striking the floor both balls have a velocity $v$. Just after the combination hits the floor, the ball of large mass moves up with a veloctiy $v$ whereas the ball of small mass is still moving down with a velocity $v$, making the two balls relative speed $2 v$. So, the ball of small mass is approaching the ball of large mass with a velocity of $2 v$. When the collision is elastic, the velocity of the ball of small mass after the collision is again $2 v$, but now in the opposite direction. So the ball of small mass moves away from the ball of large mass with a velocity $2 v$. Relative to the floor, the ball of large mass moves up with a velocity $v$, so the ball of small mass moves up with a velocity $3 v$ relative to the floor. (See figures 1 to 5 )

The small ball would have gone up with a velocity $v$ if it had just hit the floor, but now it takes off with a velocity $3 v$. Because $m g h=1 / 2 m v^{2}$, a 3 times higher take-off velocity means that it goes 9 times higher.

## Superballs

- Do not rest the table-tennis ball on the basketball and drop it as such a combination. When this is done, the table-tennis ball stays fixed to the basketball (aerodynamic reason) and for this demonstration it is needed that on hitting the ground there is some distance between the two balls.
- It is recommended that the dropping of the balls is practiced, especially dropping the small and large ball simultaneously.
- An extension of the demonstration is to drop a stack of three or even more balls ("Astro-superball"; see Diagram). When a three-ball combination is dropped, the top ball approaches a maximum of 49 times the initial release height. In order to drop the Astroball-stack perfectly vertical, wetten your fingers holding the stack and slowly let it slip away.
- The experiment does not perform very well on a woorden floor.
