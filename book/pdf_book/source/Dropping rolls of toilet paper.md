## Dropping rolls of toilet paper

Presentation: Two rolls of toilet paper are dropped simultaneously from the same height ( $\approx 2 \mathrm{~m}$ ), one of them while holding on to the paper-end of the roll. This roll hits the floor later than the other.

Explanation: When you drop the toilet paper roll while holding on to one end, the roll is momentarily rotating about an axis at the edge of the roll. The angular acceleration $(\alpha)$ of the roll during its fall can be found from $\alpha=\frac{\tau}{I}$, where the net torque is given by $\tau=m g r_{2}$ (see Figure 1).

Figure 1

The acceleration of the center of mass (a) is related to the angular acceleration of the roll by $a=\alpha r_{2}$, so the roll accelerates downward by $a=\frac{m g r_{2}^{2}}{I}$.

Since $I>m r_{2}^{2}\left(I=\frac{m}{2\left(r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}\right)}+m r_{2}^{2}\right)$, we find that $a<g$.

Remarks:

- Working with the above formulas, it can easily be shown that $a=\frac{2}{3+R^{2}} g$,

where $R=\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}$. For our toilet rolls $R=0.4$, so $a=0.63 \mathrm{~g}$.

This means that when the paper-end held roll is dropped from a height of about $1.25 \mathrm{~m}$ and the other roll from a height of about $2 \mathrm{~m}$, both rolls hit the floor simultaneously.
