## Diffraction(2b), single slit

## Presentation: Preparation

The demonstration is set up as shown in Diagram:

-The two mirrors are positioned in such a way that the laserbeam passes parallel to the table. -The two lenses ( $+10 \mathrm{~mm}$ and $+50 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) are positioned at an intermediate distance of $60 \mathrm{~mm}$. Having passed these lenses, the laserbeam is broadened. Take care that the broadened beam is still parallel to the table.

-The lens of $132 \mathrm{~mm}$ can easily be shifted in this beam up and down using the carefully positioned guidance rail.

## Demonstration

The set-up as described in "Preparation" is shortly explained to the students. The most important in this explanation is that the slit will be placed in a broadened beam and that the adjustable slit will be illuminated by plane waves.

The laser is switched on. A spot of $2 \mathrm{~cm}$ projects on the wall (see "Diffraction(2a) in this databse). The $+132 \mathrm{~mm}$-lens is placed at the end of the guiding ruler, to project an enlarged image of the interference-pattern as it will be "seen" around $85 \mathrm{~cm}$ (1m-132mm) behind the slit. The broadened and enlarged beam projects as a spot on the wall (diameter of the spot is around $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ ). The slit is closed and positioned in the beam. (By means of an overheadsheet it is shown to the students what the geometrical projection will show to us (see Figure1): When the wall is at a distance as indicated in this figure, then the slitwidth $a$ is projected 20 times larger on the wall. So when the slitwidth is $0,1 \mathrm{~mm}$, then we will see a width of $2 \mathrm{~mm}$.)

Figure 1

Slowly, the slit is opened to $0.1 \mathrm{~mm}$ : A broad band of light appears, still faint but visible to all, and: much broader than the geometrical band of light would be! We estimate around $20 \mathrm{~cm}$, a hundred times wider than expected! Increasing the slit width, we observe:

## Diffraction(2b), single slit

-slit at $0.2 \mathrm{~mm}$, band of light $=15 \mathrm{~cm}$, first subsidiary maxima appear;

-slit at $0.3 \mathrm{~mm}$, central band of light $=8 \mathrm{~cm}$, four subsidiary maxima on both sides;

-further opening of slit compresses the observed diffraction pattern;

-slit at $0.7 \mathrm{~mm}$, central band of light $=1 \mathrm{~cm}$, around 10 subsidiary maxima on both sides (see DiagramC; reality is much better than this photograph).

At this $0.7 \mathrm{~mm}$ slit width the first subsidiary maxima are almost as intens as the central maximum. Usually here we stop the demonstration (see Remarks).

Explanation: When the slit is $0.1 \mathrm{~mm}$ and the geometrical projection would be only $2 \mathrm{~mm}$ wide, clearly light is bending, broadening the band to $20 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Many textbooks give a detailed explanation (see Sources). We consider Figure2.

Figure 2

At $\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{N}$ secondary wavelets superimpose, having a pathdifference of $\frac{a}{N} \sin \theta$. Applying phasor addition (see Figure2B), $\mathrm{A}_{p}$ is the resultant wave amplitude at $\mathrm{P}$. At $\mathrm{O}$, the total amplitude of the

secondary wavelets will be the arclength in that phasordiagram, since all vectors then have the same phase. At Q ( $\theta$ is larger) the phasedifference between the "individual" secondary wavelets is larger and the phasordiagram (Figure2C) shows that the total amplitude can eventually be zero.

Analysis gives for the intinsities $\left(I_{\theta}\right)$ (see textbooks): $\frac{I_{\theta}}{I_{0}}=\left[\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)}{\frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda}}\right]^{2}=\left[\frac{\sin \alpha}{\alpha}\right]$. Minima occur at $\sin \alpha=0$, so when $\alpha=\mathrm{n} \pi$, and maxima at $\alpha=\left(\frac{2 n+1}{2}\right) \pi$. The intensities of these maxima are then given by $\frac{I_{\theta}}{I_{0}}=\frac{\sin ^{2} \alpha}{\alpha}=\frac{4}{(2 n+1)^{2} \pi^{2}}$.

$\mathrm{n}=1$ gives $\mathrm{I}_{1}=0.045 \mathrm{I}_{0}$;

$\mathrm{n}=2, \mathrm{I}_{2}=0.016 \mathrm{I}_{0}$, etc.

So, the subsidiary maxima are comparatively weak, but yet clearly visible as the demonstration showed.

Remarks:

- The $+132 \mathrm{~mm}$ lens is positioned at a distance of about $1 \mathrm{~m}$ away from the slit. This means that on the wall an image is projected of a point around $85 \mathrm{~cm}$ (1m-132mm) away from that slit. In that way it is assured that the diffraction pattern is far field Fraunhofer pattern. Increasing the slitopening beyond $0.7 \mathrm{~mm}$ will transfer the projected pattern into a Fresnel diffraction pattern, spoiling (complicating) our demonstration. The transition form Fraunhofer to Fresnel diffraction occurs in this set-up at around (see Figure1): $s=a^{2} / 2 \lambda, s=85 \mathrm{~cm}$, so $a=1 \mathrm{~mm}$. In this single slit introductory demonstration we should not go beyond that width. (See the demonstration "Fraunhofer-Fresneldiffraction" in this database.)
