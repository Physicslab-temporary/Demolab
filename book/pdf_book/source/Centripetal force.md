## Centripetal force

Presentation: Hold the conical beaker filled with water upside-down in your hands. The ping-pong ball stands vertically above the rubber stop. Make yourself turn in a circle and while turning observe the ping-pong ball (see Figure 1).

Figure 1

The ping-pong ball is displaced towards you.

Explanation: The ping-pong ball being completely immersed in water experiences an upward thrust $F_{u}$ that is larger than its weight $m g$. The net force ( $F_{u}-m g$ ) is directed upwards. The tension $T$ in the string prevents that the ping-pong ball floats upwards (see Figure 2a).

Figure 2

When turning around in circles the ping-pong ball is forced to move in a circle. A centripetal force is needed for that. Figure $2 b$ shows the new situation of equilibrium: the net upward force and tension are compensated by a centripetal force $F_{c}$. Any other position of the ping-pong ball is not a situation of equilibrium (drawing a free body diagram of the forces will show this).

## Remarks:

- When an air-bubble is trapped in the conical beaker filled with water, this bubble will behave in the same way as the ping-pong ball does.
- When you move the system from left to right, the acceleration on the left side and the deceleration on the right side can be observed. In general: the system can be used as an acceleration-meter.
