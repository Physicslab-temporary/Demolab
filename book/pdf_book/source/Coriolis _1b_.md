# Coriolis (1b) 

Aim: To show the effect on an object moving with constant velocity in a rotating reference frame.

Subjects: $\quad 1 E 20$ (Rotating Reference Frames) 1 E30 (Coriolis Effect)

Equipment:

- Rotating platform.
- Board, with square grid $\left(10 \times 10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\right)$.
- Tripod with camera fixed to rotating platform.
- Large tripod to hold cables to the camera (see Diagram).
- Clamping material.

Safety:

- Take care not to make too many rotations into one direction, because then the cables to the camera twist too much.


## Coriolis (1b)

Presentation: This demonstration is equal to "Coriolis $1 \mathrm{a}$ " in this database. The difference is that now the camera presents directly to the audience what is observed on the rotating platform.

Again show that the steel ball follows a straight line in the lecturehall's frame of reference, while the camera shows a curved path.

Rotate the platform in both directions.

Explanation: $\vec{F}_{\text {cor }} \vec{F}_{\text {cor }}=2 m\left(\bar{v}^{\prime} \times \bar{\omega}\right) . \vec{v}^{\prime}$ and $\bar{\omega}$ are continuously perpendicular to each other. Figure 1 shows

Figure 1

the direction of the resulting $F_{\text {cor }}$. So $F_{\text {cor }}$ points as seen from $\vec{v}^{\prime}$ continuously to the left, giving $m$ a counter clockwise path.

When the platform rotates into the other direction, in Figure $1 \bar{\omega}$ will point upward and the resulting $\vec{F}_{\text {cor }}$ will be the opposite direction.
