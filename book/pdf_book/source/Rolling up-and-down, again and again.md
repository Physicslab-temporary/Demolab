# Rolling up-and-down, again and again 

Aim: Determining the coefficient of rolling friction and to give an impression how low the coefficient of rolling friction is.

Subjects: $1 K 20$ (Friction)

Diagram:

Equipment:

- U-shaped railtrack
- Metal ball


## Rolling up-and-down, again and again

Presentation: Release the ball and it will roll down the track, climb the other track, and so on. But gradually the distance it rolls reduces (due to rolling friction).

After $\mathrm{n}$ runs the coefficient of rolling friction can be determined by measuring the distance the ball travels upward in the n-th run.

Explanation: The potential energy of the ball equals (see Figure 1 and 2)

Figure 1

$U_{p}(0)=m g s_{0} \sin (\alpha)=F s_{0}$

Reacting the other side (1): $U_{p}(0)-U_{p}(1)=F_{f}\left(s_{0}+s_{1}\right)$

So: $F\left(s_{0}-s_{1}\right)=F_{f}\left(s_{0}+s_{1}\right)$

$s_{1}=s_{0}\left[\frac{F-F_{f}}{F+F_{f}}\right]=s_{0}\left[\frac{1-\frac{F_{f}}{F}}{1+\frac{F_{f}}{F}}\right]=s_{0} b$

Rolling back ( $\mathrm{s}_{1}$ ) and up ( $\mathrm{s}_{2}$ ) again:

$s_{2}=s_{1} \cdot b=s_{0} \cdot b^{2}$

The coefficient of friction $(\mu)$ is by definition $F_{f} / F_{N}$.

In this case (see Figure 2): $\mu=\frac{F_{f}}{F} \tan \alpha$.

Figure 2

So the coefficient of friction can be determined by measuring $s_{0}, s_{2}$ and $\alpha$ and using the formulas above.
