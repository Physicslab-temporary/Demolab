## Precession (2)

Presentation: The wheel is supported by strings tied to both handles. The wheel is given a fast spin by hand. Now one of the supporting strings is cut. The wheel starts to precess about a vertical axis (while its own horizontal axis of spin slowly descends toward the vertical). As the spin of the wheel diminishes, the wheel precesses more rapidly.

Explanation: Since angular momentum is a vector quantity that may be conveniently represented by a vector parallel to the axis of spin, the combination of two angular momenta may be treated by the parallelogram law. Thus, whenever a gyroscope is acted upon by a torque tending to produce rotation about an axis perpendicular to the axis of spin, the gyroscope will precess about a third axis perpendicular to the other two.

Figure 3

The spinning wheel has an angular momentum of $I \omega_{0}$. This is represented by a vector parallel to the axis of spin (see Figure 1). When one of the strings is cut, then gravitational torque ( $\mathrm{mgs}$ ) is added to the system (see Figure 2 ). This torque tends to change $I \omega_{0}$, so $I \omega_{b}$ moves into the direction of $m g s$ (see Figure 3).

It can be shown that the speed of precession $\left(\omega_{p}\right)$ is given by $\omega_{p}=\frac{m g s}{I \omega_{f}}$, so slowing down of $\omega_{0}$ increases $\omega_{0}$. The precession will also be more rapid by adding a weight to the unsupported handle.
