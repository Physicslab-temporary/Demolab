# No tipping allowed 

Aim: To show that a cylinder that slides to a stop tips only if its diameter-to-height ratio is less than the reciprocal of the coefficient of kinetic friction.

Subjects: $1 K 20$ (Friction)

Equipment:

- 5 pvc cylinders, $\varphi 80 \mathrm{~mm}$

$I_{1}=285 \mathrm{~mm}$

$\mathrm{I}_{2}=320 \mathrm{~mm}$

$I_{3}=335 \mathrm{~mm}$

$\mathrm{I}_{4}=350 \mathrm{~mm}$

$I_{5}=385 \mathrm{~mm}$

- Horizontal surface (smooth table)


## No tipping allowed

Presentation: The lateral standing cylinder is given a push by hand. (Push the cylinder on the bottom half, a number of times from left to right and vice versa).

Cylinder $\mathrm{I}_{1}$ never tips, $\mathrm{I}_{5}$ always tips, $\mathrm{I}_{2}, \mathrm{I}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{I}_{4}$ tip sometimes/often ( $\mathrm{I}_{3}, 50 \%$ ).

Explanation: On the verge of tipping, the upward normal force acts at the leading edge of the base (Figure 1, point A).

Figure 1

In the decelarating reference frame ma acts on the center of mass, along with the vertical gravitational force $\mathrm{mg}$. (See Figure 2).

Figure 2

When the resultant of ma and $\mathrm{mg}$ is directed to point $\mathrm{A}$, the cylinder is on the verge of tipping. Figure 2 shows that in that case $\mu_{k}=d / h$.

Remarks: When constructing the demonstration, you need to know the value of $\mu_{k}$ before you can cut the cylinder to the proper heights. $\mu_{k}$ can easily be determined by placing a short cylinder on an inclined board and finding the angle of incline for which the cylinder slides at constant speed after being given an initial push. $\mu_{k}=\tan (\alpha)$ ( $\alpha=$ angle of incline).
