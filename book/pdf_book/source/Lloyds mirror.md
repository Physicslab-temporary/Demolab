## Lloyds mirror

Presentation: The room is darkened and the laser is switched on. By means of the +10 mm-lens an illuminated disk is projected on the white screen. The surface mirror is placed parallel to the diverging light beam (see figure 1)

and then turned just a little, so that the outer rays of the beam are reflected (see figure 2). In the light spot on the wall the fringes are visible now.

Explanation: A portion of the wavefront is reflected from $S$ (see figure 3).

The other portion proceeds directly to the screen. Interference occurs in the region where the two portions are superimposed $S$ and its mirrorimage $S_{1}$ can be considered as separate coherent sources, placed a distance $a$ apart. Then the separation ( $\Delta y$ ) between the fringes is given by $\Delta y \approx \frac{S}{a} \lambda$ ( $s$ being the distance between the plane of the two sources and the screen).

Remarks: In the demonstration the distance between the fringes can be enlarged by placing the screen not perpendicular but more parallel to the beam.
