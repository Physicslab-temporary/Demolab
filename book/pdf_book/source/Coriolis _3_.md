## Coriolis (3)

Presentation: On the globe our local position is indicated by sticking a small puppet at our coordinates (Delft, $52^{\circ}$ Nothern latitude; see DiagramA). On the globe the sense of rotation is indicated by arrows stuck to the equator. This sense of rotation is also indicated by the $\omega_{0}$-vector stuck into the Northpole.

The flexible straw is used as a resource to indicate simultaneously the direction of $\omega_{0}$ and the direction into which an object is moving (velocity $v$ ). The long arm of the straw is used to indicate the direction of $\omega_{0}$ and the short arm used to indicate the direction of $v$. Applying the corkscrew rule ( $\vec{F}_{c o r}=-2 m(\vec{\omega} \times \vec{v})$ ), the direction of $F_{c o r}$ is indicated by sticking the toothpick into the elbow of the flexible straw (see Diagram). The advantage of using the flexible straw is that easily the angle between $\omega_{o}$ and $v$ can be changed; the toothpick can be easily shifted in and out the elbow when the corkscrew rule indicates that the direction of $F_{\text {cor }}$ is different (see Figure1).
