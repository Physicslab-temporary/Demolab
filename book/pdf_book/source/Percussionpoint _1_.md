Equipment:

- Platform with grid, used as reference.
- Ruler, $1 \mathrm{~m}$.
- Stick.


## Percussionpoint (1)

Presentation: 1. Place the ruler with its centerline on the thick centerline of the grid (see Diagram). With the stick you give a short blow to the center of the stick (a movement like you are playing pool-billiards). There will result a translation of the stick.

2. Again place the ruler with its centerline on the grid. With the stick you give a short blow to the ruler e.g. at $60 \mathrm{~cm}$. There will result a translation and rotation of the stick.
3. With the stick you give a short blow to the ruler at $100 \mathrm{~cm}$. There will result a translation and rotation of the stick. Special is that it rotates around the point of $33 \mathrm{~cm}$ on the ruler.
4. With the stick you give a short blow to the ruler at $67 \mathrm{~cm}$. There will result a translation and rotation of the stick. Special is that it rotates around the beginning of the stick.

The point, around whioch the stick rotates is called "percussionpoint". In Presentation3 and -4 , this point is on the stick; in Presentation2 it is outside the stick.

Explanation: Due to the short blow, the ruler performs a movement that can be considered as consisting of two movements: a translation and rotation around its center of mass CM (see Figure1).

Figure 1

During the short blow force acts on the ruler. The total momentum of this force is $\int F d t=p$. The ruler gets a speed $v_{c}$, so the momentum of the ruler is $m v_{c}$. This makes $v_{c}=p / m$.

Relative to $\mathrm{CM}$ the ruler has also an angular momentum $I_{c} \omega_{c}=b p$ (see Figure2). So $\omega_{c}=b p / I_{c}$ On one side of $\mathrm{CM}, v_{c}$ and $\omega_{c}$ have the same direction; on the other side $v_{c}$ and $\omega_{c}$ are

opposite to each other. Looking at point A: $v_{A}=v_{c}-\omega_{c} x$. When point A remains at rest after the blow (A is then the socalled percussion point) then $0=v_{c}-\omega_{c} x$. This happens at $x=\frac{v_{c}}{\omega_{c}}=\frac{p / m}{b p / I_{c}}=\frac{I_{c}}{m b}$. For this ruler: $I_{c}=1 / 12 m \mathcal{P}^{2}$, making $x=\frac{1}{12} \frac{l^{2}}{b}$.

Applying this to the different situations of the Presentation shows the observed percussion points: in Presentation1 $(\mathrm{b}=0),-3(\mathrm{~b}=.5 \mathrm{~m})$ and -4 ( $\mathrm{b}=.17 \mathrm{~m})$. In Presentation2 $(\mathrm{b}=.1 \mathrm{~m})$, the percussion point is outside the ruler $(\mathrm{x}=.83 \mathrm{~m})$.

- Playing billiards with a stick instead with a ball needs practice!
