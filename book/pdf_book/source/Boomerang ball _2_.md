Equipment: - Superball.

- Table.

Safety:

- A superball can jump into many unexpected directions, so mind vulnerable objects in the neighborhood.


## Boomerang ball (2)

Presentation: The table is positioned as shown in Diagram. The ball is thrown as shown. The ball bounces to a fro.

Explanation: As a basis to explanation see the demonstration "Boomerang ball (1)" in this database.

Using a large basketball thrown against the floor and then bouncing against a vertical wall, shows that after hitting the vertical wall the basketball still rotates clockwise. Figure $1 \mathrm{~A}$ shows this.

(The effect of the friction force $F_{R}$ in $\mathrm{Q}$ is not that large as that of $F_{R}$ in $\mathrm{P}$, since the ball approaches the vertical wall with $\vec{p}_{h}$ and this momentum is smaller than

$\vec{p}_{v}$ in P.)

Having hit the vertical wall the ball climbs steep (see Figure 1A). A parabolatrajectory follows. On hitting the floor in R, the friction force is directed to the right (Figure 1B). The impulse $\int F_{r} d t$ is large enough to make the component

$\vec{p}_{h}$ change direction and $\bar{M}=\vec{r} \times \vec{F}_{R}$ is inducing a counter clockwise rotation. It bounces towards $S$ and again $F_{R}$ is directed to the inner side of the parabola, making the component $\vec{p}_{h}$ reverse direction and $\bar{M}=\vec{r} \times \vec{F}_{R}$ inducing clockwise rotation. And so on.

## Remarks:

- Practicing this demonstration against a real wall will learn that this part of the demonstration can also be appreciated on its own. Having the right speed and right angle, a very high climbing ball will be the result of your practicing. Figure $1 \mathrm{~A}$ shows the explanation of this phenomenon: After bouncing at $\mathrm{Q}$, $\vec{p}_{v}$ has a very high value.
- A nice variation to this demonstration is the "drunken student" (sorry, "drunken sailor"). To throw a ball that follows such a staggering trajectory, see Figure 2.
