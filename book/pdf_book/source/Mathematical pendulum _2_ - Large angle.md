Equipment:

- Pendulum; brass bob attached to a threaded rod $(I=50 \mathrm{~cm})$ and connected to a support with ballbearing.
- Large cardboard with the principal angles of deflection indicated on it (see Diagram).
- Photogate
- Computerinterface.
- Computer with data-acquisition system. (we use PASCO Science Workshop)


## Mathematical pendulum (2) Large angle

Presentation: The photogate is placed just offset the rest-position of the pendulum. The dataacquisition system is set up in such a way that a graph of periodtimes can be presented. The data-acquisition is started, and by hand the pendulum is given a deflection of almost $180^{\circ}$ and released. When $\theta$ has reached angles smaller than $90^{\circ}$, the dataacquisition is stopped. During the data-acquisition the students observe the graph displayed (see red line in Figure 1).

Figure 1

(This means that the expected range of the axes of the graph have to be prepared before the demonstration is started.)

A second run is made, giving the pendulum the smallest deflection possible. After about $10-20$ registrations of $T$ the data-acquisition is stopped. The complete graph can be observed and discussed now.

Explanation:

The equation that describes the motion of the mass $m$ is given by $a_{x}=\frac{d^{2 s}}{d t^{2}}=-g \sin \theta$ (x-direction along the tangent of the circle; see Figure2A). This is not a simple harmonic motion since $\sin \theta$ is not proportional to $s$.

Only for small amplitude oscillations $\sin \theta \approx \theta=\frac{S}{l}$ and the equation of motion reduces to $\frac{d^{2} s}{d t^{2}}=-\frac{g}{l} s$ This is the differential equation for simple harmonic motion. Then the period is given by $T=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$

For large amplitudes we need $a_{x}=-g \sin \theta$ in stead of $a_{x}=-g \theta$. Since $\sin \theta<\theta$, this means that $a_{x}$ is smaller than the small-amplitude equation indicates: The mass will need more time than $T=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$ to reach its maximum deflection. In other words: $T$ is

larger than $2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$.

(For an exact solution to the equation of motion: see literature.)

- Also see the demonstration "Mathematical pendulum (1) - Simple harmonic motion" in this database. With that demonstration the effect on the acceleration $a$ can be observed very well.
- When you observe the pendulum directly by eye it can be seen directly that the period of oscillation is larger at larger angles.
- The software is setup in such a way that the period is presented after the pendulum has passed three times through the photogate. Every next period is presented after every second passage (see Figure2B).

- Since the system measures the complete period the position of the photogate can be at any arbitrary point along the arc of motion.
