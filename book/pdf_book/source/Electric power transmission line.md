Equipment:

- 6Vac-source.
- Lamp, 6V/30W
- NiCr-wire; d=.25mm: $22 \Omega / \mathrm{m}$; two lengths of $5 \mathrm{~m}$ each.
- 4 insulated clamps to mount wires to standing posts.
- 2 transformers, $\mathrm{n}_{1}=15, \mathrm{n}_{2}=500$.
- Multiscale voltmeter, large display.


## Electric power transmission line

Presentation: First it is shown that the $6 \mathrm{~V} / 30 \mathrm{~W}$ glows brightly when connected to the $6 \mathrm{~V}$ powersupply. The demonstration is set up as shown in Diagram and Figure1A. Tell the students that in order to simulate a long distance between the powersupply and the lamp resistancewire is used between them.

Figure 1

The powersupply is switched on, but the lamp shows no light. Using the voltmeter it is seen that there is no voltage across the lamp. Sliding the leads of the voltmeter along the long wires shows that all the voltage of the powersupply is lost in these wires. The two identical transformers are connected into the circuit (see Figure1B). The powersupply is switched on and the lamp lights brightly!

Explanation: In the first part of the demonstration almost all power is lost in the long wires, because of the high resistance of these wires compared to the resistance-value of the lamp. In the second part of the demonstration, the first transformer steps the $6 \mathrm{~V}$ up to $200 \mathrm{~V}$ (using the voltmeter this can be checked). To transport power at such a higher voltage a much lower current is needed; the current in the "long" wires is now $500 / 15$ times lower than in part A of the demonstration. Then the power lost in these wires is $(500 / 15)^{2}$ times lower; the powerloss in the transportwires is reduced more than a factor 1000 !

## Electric power transmission line

To calculate exactly we have to consider Figure1C.

The lamp has a resistance of about $1 \Omega$. Since $E_{2}=E_{1}\left(n_{2} / n_{1}\right)$ and $I_{2}=I_{1}\left(n_{1} / n_{2}\right)$, we find $E_{2} / I_{2}=R_{\text {lamp }}\left(n_{2} / n_{1}\right)^{2}$. This results in that $E_{2}$ 'sees' $R_{\text {lamp }}$ as $1111 \Omega$.

Figure1D explains the rest: The $6 \mathrm{~V}$ of the powersupply is transformed by the first transformer to 200 V. Considering the resistancevalues, $167 \mathrm{~V}$ remains at the second transformer. This second transformer steps this voltage down to $5 \mathrm{~V}$. This is enough to make the lamp glow.

Remarks:

- Take care with the $200 \mathrm{~V}$ in the second part of the demonstration.
- If relevant, you can show that a bird is safe on such a high-voltage transmissionline. Just grab one lead and hold it. Nothing happens. There will happen only something when you grab also the other lead by your other hand (do not try this!).
