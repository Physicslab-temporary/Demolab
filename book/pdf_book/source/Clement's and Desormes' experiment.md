Equipment:

- Large container (we use a 5 liter decantationbottle)
- valve with large opening, $10 \mathrm{~mm}$
- syringe, $100 \mathrm{ml}$
- U-tube manometer


## Clement's and Desormes' experiment.

Presentation: The valve of the container is closed. By means of the syringe an amount of air is pushed into the container. The manometer shows the raised pressure in the container $\left(h_{1}\right)$. Now the valve of the container is opened for a short time (just long enough to have the pressure in- and outside the container to be equal; about is in our situation). After closing the valve, the manometer shows that the pressure inside the container rises and after some time reaches a fixed value $\left(h_{2}\right)$.

The ratio of heat capacities, $C_{\rho} / C_{V}$ can now be determined by $\gamma=\frac{C p}{C V}=\frac{h_{1}}{h_{1}-h_{2}}$

Explanation: The air in the container and syringe is at room temperature $T_{0}$ and pressure $p_{0}$. Pressing the syringe raises the pressure to $p_{1}$. The manometer reads $h_{1}$. (See Figure 1.)

Figure 1

Opening the valve makes the air expand adiabatically to pressure $p_{0}$ and temperature falls to $T_{2}$. The valve is quickly closed and now the trapped air in the container raises isochorically in temperature to $T_{0}$ and pressure $p_{3}$. The manometer reads $h_{2}$. Consider the isothermic - and adiabatic process:

Isothermic: $p V=$ const. $V d p+p d V=O\left(\frac{d y}{d V}\right)_{i}=-\frac{p}{V}$

Adiabatic: $p V^{r}=$ const., $V^{r} d p+p V^{r-1} d V=0,\left(\frac{d p}{d V}\right)_{a}=-\gamma \frac{p}{V}$

These two combined: $\left(\frac{d p}{d V}\right)_{a}=\gamma\left(\frac{d p}{d V}\right)_{i}$

Consider this for the same $d V$ in both processes (see Figure 1) and we find:

$\frac{d p_{a}}{d p_{i}}=\gamma=\frac{h_{1}}{h_{1}-h_{2}}$

Remarks:

- It is easy to repeat the experiment a number of times.
- Instead of starting the experiment by pressing air into the container it can also be performed by sucking air out of it. (Figure 1 will be different, of course.)
