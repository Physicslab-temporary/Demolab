Equipment:

- T-tube, $\varnothing 10$
- rubber hose (about 2 meters)
- faucet
- tray to catch the water


## Recoil of a water-jet

Presentation: The rubber hose with T-tube hangs vertically down. Opening the faucet makes the Ttube move away.

When a plate is held in the water-jet nothing changes.

When the plate is fixed to the T-tube the hose stays vertically in its position.

Explanation: In order to convert a downward waterflow into a sideways waterflow, the T-tube has to exert a force on the water. The reaction to this force is responsible for the recoil to the other side.

When a plate is placed in the outcoming waterstream, it also exerts a force on the plate. When this plate is fixed to the T-tube, these two forces cancel, so there is no recoil

Remarks: This demonstration can be performed by the students themselves, by giving each of them a flexible soda straw, giving it a $90^{\circ}$ bend (Figure 1).

Figure 1

Blowing hard in the long part of the straw, the free end recoils. The no-recoil can be observed when a small plastic bag is attached at the end of the straw.
