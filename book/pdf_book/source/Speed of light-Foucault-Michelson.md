## Speed of light; Foucault-Michelson

## Presentation: Preparation:

Make the laserbeam go as horizontal as possible; careful alignment is essential in this demonstration. (Start at the laser and work step by step working yourself through the lightpath.)

The $+5 m$-lens is positioned at about $5 \mathrm{~m}$ distance from the rotating mirror.

Figure 1

Image-distance $b$ (see Figure1A) is chosen such that the image of the first mirror $\left(\mathrm{M}_{1}\right)$ is sharp at $M_{3}\left(\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{r+f}+\frac{1}{b}\right)$. (In our assembly this means that $b$ is around 25 meters.) Lens $+5 \mathrm{~m}$ and $M_{3}$ are carefully adjusted until, in the right postion of the rotating mirror $\left(M_{r}\right)$ the laserbeam is reflected to the camera (the camera and $M_{1}$ have the same distance to $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ ). Making the rotating mirror turn at its highest speed (about 500 rev. per second) the lightspot displaces, in our assembly, the whole width of the monitorscreen. This displacement is calibrated by placing a plastic ruler between the greyfilter and the camera (see Figure2A).

Figure 2

Shadow projection of the mm-lines on the sensitive layer of the camera show these lines on the monitor (we have $7 \mathrm{~mm}$ across the full width of the monitorscreen; see Figure2B). The geometry of the assembly makes it possible to link the rotation of the mirror to the displacement on the monitorscreen (we have a displacement of around

$2.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ on the camera, corresponding to $\phi=\frac{d}{2 r}=\frac{2.5 \times 10^{-3}}{2 \times 2.6}=0.48 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{rad}$ of $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{r}}$ ).

Demonstration:

The laser is switched on and the lightpath is shown to the students. By hand the rotating mirror is turned until a flash is seen on the monitorscreen. In this position the lightpath is as drawn in the Diagram. The principle of operation is explained to the students: In the time it takes the light beam to travel the distance $M_{r}-M_{3}-M_{r}$ the rotating mirror has made a little angle ( $\varphi$ ). This is observed on the monitorscreen (angle $2 \varphi$, see Figure1B).

Also the calibration is explained to the students.

While the speed of rotation of $M_{r}$ increases the students see an increasing displacement of the lightspot on the monitorscreen. While running at a convenient speed (we use $n=500 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ to make calculations easy), this reading and that of the displacement on the monitorscreen are used to calculate the speed of light.

Explanation: During the time ( $\Delta t$ ) it takes the light beam to travel the distance $M_{r}-M_{3}-M_{r}$ the rotating mirror has made a little angle $(\varphi)$ that is read from the monitorscreen. Observing the speed of rotation on the frequencymeter, the time it took to make this little angle can

be calculated. For instance we measure when $M_{r}$ runs at $500 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, a lightspot displacement of $d=2.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ on the monitorscreen. This means an angle of rotation of that mirror of $\phi=\frac{d}{2 r}=\frac{2.5 \times 10^{-3}}{2 \times 2.6}=0.48 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{rad}$. With $n=500 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}(500 \times 2 \pi \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{sec})$

this means a time-span of $\Delta t=\frac{0.48 \times 10^{-3}}{500 \times 2 \pi}=0.15 \mu \mathrm{sec}$. (So, the displacement measurement on the monitorscreen becomes in this way a $\Delta t$-measurement.) Our distance $\mathrm{f}+\mathrm{b}=23$ meter. This gives us $c=\frac{2 \times 23}{0.15 \times 10^{-6}}=3.1 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. (The measurement of the lightspot displacement on the monitorscreen is done very roughly, so our result of $\mathrm{c}=3.1 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$ is satisfying.)

Remarks:

- Since 1984 the speed of light is a universal constant (having the exact value of $299792458 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$; in vacuum). So principally it cannot be measured. Doing this experiment means measuring the distance $f+b$. But we just do the demonstration and "measure" the speed of light and in the end we mention this "complication" to the students.
- Measuring the speed of rotation with the photodiode is complicated since the lightspot sweeps very fast across the photodiode. We use a $+150 \mathrm{~mm}$ lens to make the lightspot stay longer on the photodiode during its sweep (see Diagram).
- The "grey filter" shown in the Diagram is a variable neutral density filter used to adjust the lightintensity to the camera.
